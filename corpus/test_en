San FRANCISCO – It has never been easy to have a rational conversation about the value of gold .
lately , with gold prices up more than 300 % over the last decade , it is harder than ever .
just last December , fellow economists Martin Feldstein and Nouriel Roubini each penned op-eds bravely questioning bullish market sentiment , sensibly pointing out gold ’ s risks .
wouldn ’ t you know it ?
since their articles appeared , the price of gold has moved up still further . gold prices even hit a record-high $ 1,300 recently .
last December , many gold bugs were arguing that the price was inevitably headed for $ 2,000 .
now , emboldened by continuing appreciation , some are suggesting that gold could be headed even higher than that .
one successful gold investor recently explained to me that stock prices languished for a more than a decade before the Dow Jones index crossed the 1,000 mark in the early 1980 ’ s .
since then , the index has climbed above 10,000 .
now that gold has crossed the magic $ 1,000 barrier , why can ’ t it increase ten-fold , too ?
admittedly , getting to a much higher price for gold is not quite the leap of imagination that it seems .
after adjusting for inflation , today ’ s price is nowhere near the all-time high of January 1980 . back then , gold hit $ 850 , or well over $ 2,000 in today ’ s dollars .
but January 1980 was arguably a “ freak peak ” during a period of heightened geo-political instability .
at $ 1,300 , today ’ s price is probably more than double very long-term , inflation-adjusted , average gold prices .
so what could justify another huge increase in gold prices from here ?
one answer , of course , is a complete collapse of the US dollar .
with soaring deficits , and a rudderless fiscal policy , one does wonder whether a populist administration might recklessly turn to the printing press .
and if you are really worried about that , gold might indeed be the most reliable hedge .
sure , some might argue that inflation-indexed bonds offer a better and more direct inflation hedge than gold .
but gold bugs are right to worry about whether the government will honor its commitments under more extreme circumstances .
in fact , as Carmen Reinhart and I discuss in our recent book on the history of financial crises , This Time is Different , cash-strapped governments will often forcibly convert indexed debt to non-indexed debt , precisely so that its value might be inflated away .
even the United States abrogated indexation clauses in bond contracts during the Great Depression of the 1930 ’ s .
so it can happen anywhere .
even so , the fact that very high inflation is possible does not make it probable , so one should be cautious in arguing that higher gold prices are being driven by inflation expectations .
some have argued instead that gold ’ s long upward march has been partly driven by the development of new financial instruments that make it easier to trade and speculate in gold .
there is probably some slight truth – and also a certain degree of irony – to this argument .
after all , medieval alchemists engaged in what we now consider an absurd search for ways to transform base metals into gold .
wouldn ’ t it be paradoxical , then , if financial alchemy could make an ingot of gold worth dramatically more ?
in my view , the most powerful argument to justify today ’ s high price of gold is the dramatic emergence of Asia , Latin America , and the Middle East into the global economy .
as legions of new consumers gain purchasing power , demand inevitably rises , driving up the price of scarce commodities .
at the same time , emerging-market central banks need to accumulate gold reserves , which they still hold in far lower proportion than do rich-country central banks .
with the euro looking less appetizing as a diversification play away from the dollar , gold ’ s appeal has naturally grown .
so , yes , there are solid fundamentals that arguably support today ’ s higher gold price , although it is far more debatable whether and to what extent they will continue to support higher prices in the future .
indeed , another critical fundamental factor that has been sustaining high gold prices might prove far more ephemeral than globalization .
gold prices are extremely sensitive to global interest-rate movements .
after all , gold pays no interest and even costs something to store .
today , with interest rates near or at record lows in many countries , it is relatively cheap to speculate in gold instead of investing in bonds .
but if real interest rates rise significantly , as well they might someday , gold prices could plummet .
most economic research suggests that gold prices are very difficult to predict over the short to medium term , with the odds of gains and losses being roughly in balance .
it is therefore dangerous to extrapolate from short-term trends .
yes , gold has had a great run , but so , too , did worldwide housing prices until a couple of years ago .
if you are a high-net-worth investor , a sovereign wealth fund , or a central bank , it makes perfect sense to hold a modest proportion of your portfolio in gold as a hedge against extreme events .
but , despite gold ’ s heightened allure in the wake of an extraordinary run-up in its price , it remains a very risky bet for most of us .
of course , such considerations might have little influence on prices .
what was true for the alchemists of yore remains true today : gold and reason are often difficult to reconcile .
last week Tony Blair , Jacques Chirac , and Gerhard Schroeder met in Berlin .
they departed pledging to revive Europe &apos;s growth . we &apos;ve heard that empty promise before .
instead , the European Union needs a new direction .
I say this as leader of the party which has been at the forefront of Britain &apos;s engagement with Europe .
it was a Conservative government that first applied for membership in the early 1960 &apos;s .
a Conservative government took the United Kingdom into the European Economic Community in 1973 .
Margaret Thatcher worked with Jacques Delors to forge the Single Market in 1986 .
so I have no doubt that Britain must remain influential within the Union .
but British policy towards the EU has often led to worse rather than better relations among member states .
faced with a new EU initiative , our traditional response has often been to oppose it , vote against it , lose the vote , then sulkily to adopt it while blaming everyone else .
many Europeans are sick of British vetoes . so am I.
of course there are basic requirements that all member states must accept .
foremost are the four freedoms of the single market ; free movement of goods , services , people and capital .
but a single market does not require a single social or industrial policy , far less a common taxation policy .
allowing countries to pursue their own policies in these areas encourages competitiveness .
forcing common standards means that Europe will fall further behind as member states shuffle their costs onto their neighbours .
which areas should be applied to every member state , and which should be optional ?
I believe that every member state should administer those policies that do not directly and significantly affect other member states .
in areas which serve their national interest , individual members should decide whether to retain wholly national control or whether to co ‑ operate with others .
the Union &apos;s members should form a series of overlapping circles : different combinations of members should be able to pool their responsibilities in different areas of their own choosing .
precedents exist for this .
NATO has been flexible since its inception .
France signed up for membership but later refused to submit her armed forces to NATO &apos;s central command .
similar flexibility exists with the Euro , the Schengen Agreement , and the Social Chapter .
these precedents can be extended .
so far , everyone has had to move forward together , with individual countries negotiating specific opt ‑ outs .
but since 1998 , there has been a procedure within the Treaties - called enhanced co ‑ operation - that could allow some members to go ahead with further integration in a specific area without involving every other member .
instead of individual member states having fraught negotiations to opt ‑ out of a new initiative , those that support it can simply opt ‑ in .
countries that want to integrate further can do so .
they don &apos;t need to drag Britain and others kicking and screaming in their wake because the others are not compelled to join them .
in this way we can break free of the institutionalised tug of war that has characterised EU relations .
I am not talking about a two ‑ speed Europe . that implies that we all agree on the destination and differ only about the speed of the journey .
I don &apos;t want to reach the destination that some of our partners may aspire to . but I don &apos;t want to block their way .
there are some who say that this would mean a loss of influence on the part of those countries which choose not to integrate more closely .
but influence is not an end in itself - it is a means to an end .
Britain does not need a seat at the table when decisions on the Euro are taken .
our economy has not been adversely affected by staying out .
keeping the pound does not mean that we oppose the Euro , or hope for its failure .
the European Union should stop trying to do everything and concentrate on doing fewer things more effectively .
it should give member states the chance to develop an approach to Europe that suits their national traditions , within the EU framework .
it is on this basis that British Conservatives oppose the proposed constitution .
we disagree with many of its contents , of course , but also oppose the idea of having an EU constitution at all .
there is a world of difference between an association of nation states bound together by treaty , and a single entity , whether you call it a state or not , with its own legal personality , deriving its authority from its own constitution .
if this constitution were accepted in anything like the proposed form , the EU would gain many attributes and trappings of statehood : its own president and foreign minister , its own legal system .
the supremacy of EU law would derive not from Acts of national Parliaments but from a supra ‑ national constitution .
that is a radical change , not the mere tidying ‑ up exercise some suggest .
I do not believe it is right to make a change of such magnitude without specifically consulting the people on whose behalf we govern .
elected parliaments do not own our liberties .
they safeguard them , and should not diminish those liberties without an explicit mandate .
any proposal for a new constitution must be put to the British people and to the people in each EU member state .
Brussels – Austerity alone cannot solve Europe &apos;s economic and financial crisis .
growth and jobs need to be promoted with equal zeal .
European Union leaders now recognize this : kick-starting growth in 2012 was high on the agenda at the European Council ’ s meeting on January 30 .
but the big question remains : how ?
the need for immediate action is clear .
the eurozone ’ s economy contracted in the last three months of 2011 ; even Germany ’ s shrank .
the new year is looking grim .
France is flat-lining ( as is Britain ) .
Italy and Spain have sunk into deep recession .
Greece is in its fifth year of a slump .
and eurozone unemployment is at record highs , with nearly one in two young people jobless in Spain and Greece .
the economic headwinds are formidable : fiscal austerity , high interest rates outside AAA-rated countries , credit cutting by banks , deleveraging households , weak private-sector investment , and declining exports as the global slowdown undermines demand .
until growth resumes , any tentative financial stabilization will be extremely fragile .
recession will hit banks ’ and governments ’ already-weak balance sheets , increasing pressure for faster deleveraging .
but , while gradual adjustment is essential , faster and deeper cuts are largely self-defeating : big reductions in private credit and government spending will cause a sharper slowdown – and thus a vicious downward spiral .
a big new push for growth is therefore vital .
so far , the growth agenda has consisted largely of structural reforms , which are essential for boosting future productivity and flexibility .
the crisis does provide a political opportunity for bold moves on this front in many countries ; but structural reforms generally will not generate growth and jobs immediately ( one exception is permitting shops to open longer ) .
on the contrary , a shakeout of less productive jobs , for example , would at first raise unemployment , increase government outlays , and reduce private spending .
and , because demand is depressed , credit is in short supply , and barriers to enterprise are often high , it will take longer than usual for businesses to create more productive jobs .
in short , structural reforms alone cannot be relied upon to stimulate growth in 2012 .
instead , the immediate focus needs to be on boosting investment and exports in economies with a current-account deficit – such as France , Italy , and Spain ( and the United Kingdom ) – and stimulating consumption in surplus countries such as Germany and the Netherlands .
the European Central Bank has acted decisively to prop up European banks ; now it needs to support the real economy , too .
while official interest rates are only 1 % , solvent sovereigns such as Spain pay more than 5 % to borrow for ten years , while creditworthy businesses in Italy can borrow only at punitive rates , if at all .
while improving access to finance is vital , governments also need to do more to boost investment .
they should prioritize measures to make it easier to start a business , lift barriers to venture capital , and introduce temporary 100 % capital allowances to encourage businesses to bring forward investment .
at the EU level , the ( callable ) capital of the European Investment Bank should be greatly increased , as European Commission President José Manuel Barroso suggested in his State of the Union speech last September , so that the EIB can finance a big wave of pan-European investment , notably in infrastructure .
boosting exports is also essential .
deficit countries need to become more competitive , increasing productivity while cutting costs .
a more competitive currency would be welcome : just as the sterling ’ s collapse since 2008 has lifted UK exports , a weaker euro would help Mediterranean economies regain competitiveness for price-sensitive exports .
a fiscal devaluation – slashing payroll taxes and replacing the revenues with a higher VAT – would also help .
surplus countries , too , must do their part , which is in their own interest .
just as China needs to allow the renminbi to rise , so Germany – whose current-account surplus exceeds China &apos;s both as a share of GDP and in absolute terms – needs a higher real exchange rate .
that means that Germans need to earn higher wages , commensurate with their increased productivity , so that they can afford more Greek and Spanish holidays .
if businesses will not oblige , an income-tax cut would do the trick .
that brings us to fiscal policy .
governments that cannot borrow cheaply ( or at all ) from markets have no option but to tighten their belts .
but they should pursue smart consolidation rather than unthinking austerity .
so they should maintain investment in skills and infrastructure , while cutting subsidies and transfer payments .
they should also legislate now for future reforms , notably to encourage people to work longer .
last but not least , governments that can borrow at unprecedentedly low rates – 0 % in real terms over 10 years in the case of Germany – must play their role in supporting demand .
would it be really be so difficult to see VAT coming down ahead of the German election next year ?
at the onset of the US-led war in Iraq , two competing views shaped predictions about the outcome . the first contended that overthrowing Saddam Hussein &apos;s regime would usher in a democratic era in Iraq that would serve as a model and catalyst for democratic change regionally .
derided by detractors as a new &quot; domino theory , &quot; this view presented intervention in Iraq as similar to America &apos;s role in post-WWII Japan .
against the optimism of that &quot; Japan scenario , &quot; pessimists argued that a &quot; Somalia scenario &quot; was more likely .
they staked their claim on the tribal , sectarian , and multiethnic nature of Iraq , which , in the absence of dictatorship , would supposedly incite Iraq &apos;s collapse into a &quot; failed state , &quot; with rampant warlordism , ethnic and religious feuds , and harboring of terrorist organizations .
but the main question now is whether Iraq will drift along lines somewhere between these two scenarios , increasingly resembling Afghanistan .
this &quot; Afghan scenario &quot; implies a weak state with nominal power over effectively autonomous fiefdoms that are headed by strongmen who are represented in the central government .
bad as it sounds , this prospect appears to be a &quot; realistic &quot; compromise between the supposedly utopian vision of a flourishing , unified democracy and the wretchedness of a failed state .
many of the actions and policies of the Coalition Provisional Authority ( CPA ) , as well as higher-level Bush administration decisions , seem to point to a resigned acceptance that early hopes that Iraq would embrace Western-style democracy were misplaced .
indeed , such hopes were misplaced .
Iraq &apos;s political culture - and that of most of the Middle East - is incompatible with the basic components of a recognizable Western-style democracy : notions of individual rights and responsibilities are lacking , the concept of a patriarchal state is deeply rooted , and individual cultural identity is rarely tied to the national community .
on the other hand , much circular logic figures in analyses that consider the &quot; traditional &quot; nature of Iraqi society an obstacle to liberal democracy .
for these analyses are hardly neutral , but unwittingly enter an ongoing confrontation .
in Iraq , as elsewhere in the Arab and Muslim worlds , a cultural war is being waged between two paradigms : grand narratives that accept and promote a collectivistic understanding ( nationalism , socialism , Islamism ) , versus an implicit paradigm of individualistic modernity that is locally rooted yet informed by the global experience .
the frontlines of this war are notions of the individual , cultural identity , civil society , and the nation-state .
the religious Islamic component in Iraqi social life should not be underestimated . but it also should not be equated with the political Islamism that strives to capitalize on it .
nationalist and leftist political discourses did leave an imprint on the Iraqi value system , but they are not its sole components .
indeed , the nominal acceptance of grand narratives of &quot; democracy &quot; and &quot; human rights &quot; as common bases for political discourse represents a crucial shift in demarcating the cultural battle .
this cultural debate is not limited to the Arab scene .
there are also vigorous discussions in the West about the applicability of democratic institutions to the Arab context .
advocates of the notion of &quot; Arab exceptionalism , &quot; which questions the ability of Arab societies to adapt democratic systems are in fact objectively allied with &quot; grand narrative &quot; ideologues - and also with the beneficiaries of the Arab world &apos;s patronage-based political order .
the models used in the West , both in political circles and in academia , for the analysis and interpretation of Arab societies are seriously deficient .
in particular , many analyses nowadays promote an ethnic model , reducing Iraq to an artificial construct that rests atop a fragmented &quot; reality &quot; of separate communities .
some have even suggested hastening the outcome predicted by this faulty view by dividing Iraq into its &quot; genuine &quot; original components : Sunni , Shi &apos;i , and Kurd .
in fact , Iraqi society is more complex than this .
the reception and adoption of democracy is not a function of sectarian belonging , but a reflection of the multi-dimensional historical , cultural , religious , and political identities of Iraqi individuals .
given the right circumstances , it is eminently possible to mobilize Iraqi society towards a democratic formulation of its state-to-be .
the fall of Saddam ushers in the right circumstances .
indeed , the seeming failure of a recognizable democratic core to emerge in Iraq within the first few months of the collapse of Saddam &apos;s dictatorship is due more to idiosyncrasies of the process than to any presumed essential nature of Iraqi society .
upon Saddam &apos;s fall , a large &quot; middle ground &quot; existed in Iraq that was positively disposed towards democratic discourse and practice .
policy mistakes and reversals eroded this middle ground , opening a path for ideological Islamism and a reconstituted neo-Ba &apos;athism .
the key mistake was the failure of occupation forces to equip and empower the small group of Iraqi liberal democratic figures to tap into this middle ground .
as a result , the space for a liberal democratic outcome receded .
but to treat this setback as a failure would be a self-fulfilling prophecy .
Iraqi democrats must re-assess and develop a clear public strategy .
the CPA , and the world community , must not prejudice the outcome of their efforts by accepting a facile and bogus view of Iraqi society .
even if such efforts succeed , the road to a full-fledged democratic system in Iraq will still be arduous and expensive .
but instead of succumbing to a &quot; Somalia scenario , &quot; dreaming of a &quot; Japan scenario , &quot; or settling for an &quot; Afghanistan scenario , &quot; Iraq may yet become a &quot; scenario &quot; for successful intervention in the 21 st century .
Ankara – Nowadays , the international media are obsessed with the question of who “ lost ” Turkey and what that supposed loss means for Europe and the West .
more alarmingly , some commentators liken Turkey ’ s neighborhood policy to a revival of Ottoman imperialism .
recently , a senior Turkish columnist went so far as to quote Foreign Minister Ahmet Davutoğlu as saying that “ we are indeed neo-Ottoman . ”
as someone who was present when Davutoğlu made his presentation to the parliamentary faction of Turkey ’ s ruling Justice and Development Party ( AKP ) , I can attest to the fact that he did not use such terminology .
in fact , Davutoğlu and all of us in the AKP foreign-policy community never use this term , because it is simply a mispresentation of our position .
Turkey ’ s neighborhood policy is devised to reintegrate Turkey into its immediate neighborhoods , including the Balkans , the Black Sea , the Caucasus , the Middle East , and the Eastern Mediterranean .
we aim to deepen our political dialogue , increase our trade , and multiply our people-to-people contacts with our neighbors in the form of sports , tourism , and cultural actvities .
when Egon Bahr formulated his Ostpolitik in the 1960 ’ s , no one asked Will Brandt whether Germany was lost .
God bestowed upon Turkey a geographical position that fundamentally requires for us to engage with East and West , North and South .
this is neither a choice nor a luxury – it is a necessity .
the symbol of the Byzantine and the Selçuk Empires , which occupied roughly the same geography that Turkey does today , was a double-headed eagle looking both east and west .
it should be no wonder that Turkey is also seeking to engage both ends of its territories and feels that its security is best consolidated by minimizing risks together with its neighbors .
so we find the current debate on Turkey ’ s orientation rather superflous , and in some cases ill-intentioned .
our neighborhood policy needs support , not criticism .
Turkey has become an invaluable asset in the make-up of our surrounding regions , and is already changing the status quo in favor of more stability and predictability .
our efforts at normalization with Armenia , for example , are destined to bring change to the entire South Caucasus .
we are doing our part in terms of burden-sharing .
sensible Europeans understand that .
to be sure , some of our neighbors are difficult .
but no country has the luxury of choosing its neighbors .
Turkey ’ s neighborhood policy is very realistic , based on genuine interests , not some romantic neo-Ottoman nostagia , as more than a few international commentators have suggested .
true , there is a neo-Ottoman revival in the cultural field , and our citizens are eager to rediscover Ottoman life , culture , and practices .
as Turkey is normalizing domestically , it is also reinterpreting its national historical narrative .
this is a natural byproduct of consolidating our democracy .
however , trying to paint our carefully constructed foreign-policy initiatives with imperialist overtones is not only a stark mispresentation , but also does gross injustice to our well-intentioned efforts to stabilize our region .
in Roman mythology , Janus was the god of gates , doorways , beginnings , and endings .
Turkey today is a Janus-like geography that offers gates and doorways to the East and West .
it offers beginnings and endings to the Caucasus , the Black Sea , the Balkans , and the Mediterranean .
in this capacity , Turkey complements and contributes to a unique transitional passage between otherwise difficult regions , for it signifies centuries-old co-existence and adjustment .
Turkish foreign policy contributes to that coming together and helps its immeditate neighborhoods to connect with one another .
contrary to recent charges , Turkey ’ s foreign policymakers are not seeking to revive the Ottoman Empire .
instead , we seek Turkey ’ s historic reintegration into its immediate neighborhoods , thereby correcting an anomaly of the Cold War years .
such re-integration would only benefit the European Union and our other Western , NATO allies .
none of them , therefore , has any reason to express discomfort with Turkey .
although the EU &apos;s eastward enlargement has not yet happened , the debate is already shifting to ask what will follow : when should the new , predominantly postcommunist , members adopt the euro ?
assuming that they comply with the Maastricht Treaty &apos;s provisions concerning the EMU - and are not unfairly held to more stringent criteria - the core issue is whether new members would benefit more by waiting or whether they should seek early entry .
at the outset , it must be stressed that , in seeking earlier entry into the EMU a country assumes a more ambitious fiscal and structural program than would be needed if EMU membership is delayed .
early entry , otherwise , would be an empty gesture .
I believe that early adoption of the euro is not only possible , but preferable to delay .
by early adoption I mean the shortest permissible period of time - two years - following a new member subordinating its monetary policy to the fiscal and monetary constraints of the exchange rate mechanism ( ERM II ) .
assuming entry into both the EU and ERM II in 2004 , new members should aim to enter the eurozone around 2006 .
is this realistic ?
well , most candidate countries have already achieved a high degree of structural convergence with the EU .
exports to the Union have soared since 1991 , when the collapse of the Soviet-era COMECON trading system forced a radical reorientation of trade - helped by massive foreign investment from the EU - towards Western markets .
most accession candidates now send more exports to the EU than Greece , Portugal , and Spain did when they entered the EU and EMU .
progress on disinflation is similarly impressive .
annual inflation in most candidate countries has fallen to 4-5 % - not much higher than in many EU countries , and lower than in The Netherlands last year .
as with structural convergence , EU candidates already outperform Spain , Portugal , and Greece at a comparable time before their EMU debut .
nor is there much risk of large , future corrective price swings because all but a few prices are completely liberalized .
theoretical studies suggest that inflation in the accession countries will remain stubbornly higher than the Maastricht Treaty allows .
the culprit in this pessimistic view is the so-called &quot; Balassa-Samuelson &quot; effect : rapid productivity growth in the accession candidates &apos; tradable sectors - export manufacturing , for example - is pushing up real wages throughout their economies , including in non-tradable sectors like services .
this overall rise in real wages in the face of lower productivity growth for the service sector boosts relative prices and keeps inflation above the eurozone average .
the Balassa-Samuelson effect is still evident in Greece , Spain and Portugal .
but as empirical research prepared by the CEC5 National Banks estimates , its contribution to total price growth in the candidate countries is 1-2 % .
with the Balassa-Samuelson effect so subdued and limited scope for future corrective inflation , the EMU criterion regarding price stability - of annual inflation within 1.5 % of the average rate for the three best-performing economies in the EU - is within reach .
but is early admission to EMU preferable to postponing membership ?
from the standpoint of current member states , would admitting Hungary , Latvia , Poland , or Slovakia , sooner rather than later , drag down the euro as many fear ?
fears that extending EMU to new states &quot; too soon &quot; would undermine the euro &apos;s external exchange rate are irrational .
if all candidate countries join the EU at around the same time , they will together account for a mere 6 % of its total GDP .
so any negative impact on the euro from rapid accession to EMU would at worst amount to little more than a rounding error .
delaying entry into EMU could make sense if a longer wait produced more information .
but a wait of greater length might produce nothing but added noise .
equally , the transition period is already turbulent , with convergence-driven capital flows driving up exchange rates and complicating monetary policy in several candidate countries , including Poland , the Czech Republic , and Hungary .
indeed , capital-flow volatility could make short work of the flexible exchange rate on offer under ERM II - a 15 % fluctuation band either side of a central parity .
some argue that ERM II membership should be viewed as a longer-term proposition - possibly lasting until 2010 - for the benefit of candidates themselves .
the benefit is simple : ERM II permits some exchange rate flexibility , as opposed to the fixed rates implied by adopting the euro .
this would help keep the candidates &apos; economic output high and thus sustain real convergence with average EU income levels .
this is an exceptionally weak argument , and a politically suspect one , too .
as European Central Bank data shows , average per capita GDP in the accession candidates is 44 % of the eurozone level .
the size of the income gap combines with the small growth differentials to imply that the process of real convergence will extend far beyond even the most cautious dates for EU and EMU entry , probably lasting several decades .
more important , long-lasting economic growth does not depend on the type of exchange rate - whether flexible or fixed ( EMU ) - while early accession will speed up crucial reforms .
a few years of limited exchange rate flexibility is a poor substitute for rapid completion of structural reforms .
in almost all candidates , further disinflation and long-term economic growth require fiscal consolidation , more flexible labor markets , and completion of privatization .
delaying EMU entry risks weakening the incentive to complete these politically costly but necessary reforms .
any delay in completing reforms will ultimately slow the process of real convergence that EU officials rightly hold dear .
early adoption , by contrast , would be more conducive to these reforms , and thus to real convergence .
success here would allow candidate countries to start reaping the benefits of greater price transparency , reduced transaction costs , and a solid macroeconomic framework .
this strategy , not one of deferred entry , promises the most for both the EU &apos;s current and its future members .
Paris – As the economic crisis deepens and widens , the world has been searching for historical analogies to help us understand what has been happening .
at the start of the crisis , many people likened it to 1982 or 1973 , which was reassuring , because both dates refer to classical cyclical downturns .
today , the mood is much grimmer , with references to 1929 and 1931 beginning to abound , even if some governments continue to behave as if the crisis was more classical than exceptional .
the tendency is either excessive restraint ( Europe ) or a diffusion of the effort ( the United States ) .
Europe is being cautious in the name of avoiding debt and defending the euro , whereas the US has moved on many fronts in order not to waste an ideal opportunity to implement badly needed structural reforms .
for geo-strategists , however , the year that naturally comes to mind , in both politics and economics , is 1989 .
of course , the fall of the house of Lehman Brothers has nothing to do with the fall of the Berlin Wall .
indeed , on the surface it seems to be its perfect antithesis : the collapse of a wall symbolizing oppression and artificial divisions versus the collapse of a seemingly indestructible and reassuring institution of financial capitalism .
yet 2008-2009 , like 1989 , may very well correspond to an epochal change , whose unfolding consequences will be felt for decades .
the end of the East-West ideological divide and the end of absolute faith in markets are historical turning points .
and what happens in 2009 may jeopardize some of the positive results of 1989 , including the peaceful reunification of Europe and the triumph of democratic principles over nationalist , if not xenophobic , tendencies .
in 1989 , liberal democracy triumphed over the socialist ideology incarnated and promoted by the Soviet Bloc .
for many of his supporters , it was President Ronald Reagan who , with his deliberate escalation of the arms race , pushed the Soviet economy to the brink , thereby fully demonstrating the superiority of liberal societies and free markets .
of course , there are obvious differences between 1989 and now .
first , and perhaps above all , the revolutions of 1989 and the subsequent collapse of the Soviet Union put an end to global bipolarity . by contrast , 2009 is likely to pave the way to a new form of bipolarity , but with China substituting for the Soviet Union .
second , whereas democracy and market capitalism appeared as clear – if more fragile than expected – winners in 1989 , it is difficult in 2009 , with the spread of the global crisis , to distinguish winners from losers .
everyone seems to be a loser , even if some are more affected than others .
yet , history is unfair , and the US , despite its greater responsibility for today ’ s global crisis , may emerge in better shape than most countries from the morass .
in better shape , but not alone .
as a visiting professor at Harvard and MIT , I am getting a good preview of what the world could look like when the crisis finally passes .
one senses something like the making of an American-Asian dominated universe .
from the incredible media lab at MIT to the mathematics and economics departments at Harvard , Asians – Chinese and Indians , in particular – are everywhere , like the Romans in Athens in the first century BC : full of admiration for those from whom they were learning so much , and whom they would overcome in the coming decades .
but before this new order appears , the world may be faced with spreading disorder , if not outright chaos .
what , for example , will happen to a country as central and vulnerable as Egypt when hundred of thousands of Egyptians working in the Gulf are forced to return to their homeland as a result of the crisis in the oil-producing countries ?
when the rich get less rich , the poor get poorer .
and what about the foreign workers who have reached for the “ European dream ” and are now faced with potential explosions of xenophobia in Europe ’ s supposedly open countries ?
the consequences of 1989 ended up being less enduring than many observers , including me , would have assumed .
we can only hope that , in the end , the consequences of 2009 similarly prove to be far less dramatic than we now – intuitively and in our historical reflexes – feel them to be .
new YORK – It was a decade ago that 19 terrorists took control of four planes , flew two into the twin towers of the World Trade Center , hit the Pentagon with a third , and crashed the fourth in a field in Pennsylvania after passengers resisted and made it impossible for the terrorists to complete their malevolent mission .
in a matter of hours , more than 3,000 innocent people , mostly Americans , but also people from 115 other countries , had their lives suddenly and violently taken from them .
September 11 , 2001 , was a terrible tragedy by any measure , but it was not a historical turning point .
it did not herald a new era of international relations in which terrorists with a global agenda prevailed , or in which such spectacular terrorist attacks became commonplace .
on the contrary , 9 / 11 has not been replicated .
despite the attention devoted to the “ Global War on Terrorism , ” the most important developments of the last ten years have been the introduction and spread of innovative information technologies , globalization , the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan , and the political upheavals in the Middle East .
as for the future , it is much more likely to be defined by the United States ’ need to put its economic house in order ; China ’ s trajectory within and beyond its borders ; and the ability of the world ’ s governments to cooperate on restoring economic growth , stemming the spread of nuclear weapons , and meeting energy and environmental challenges .
it is and would be wrong to make opposition to terrorism the centerpiece of what responsible governments do in the world .
terrorists continue to be outliers with limited appeal at best .
they can destroy but not create .
it is worth noting that the people who went into the streets of Cairo and Damascus calling for change were not shouting the slogans of Al Qaeda or supporting its agenda .
moreover , measures have been implemented to push back , successfully , against terrorists .
intelligence assets have been redirected .
borders have been made more secure and societies more resilient .
international cooperation has increased markedly , in part because governments that cannot agree on many things can agree on the need to cooperate in this area .
military force has played a role as well .
Al Qaeda lost its base in Afghanistan when the Taliban government that had provided it sanctuary was ousted from power .
Osama bin-Laden was finally found and killed by US Special Forces in the suburbs of Islamabad .
drones – unmanned aircraft that are remotely steered – have proven to be effective in killing a significant number of terrorists , including many of the most important leaders .
weak governments can be made stronger ; governments that tolerate or support terrorism must be held accountable .
but progress is not to be confused with victory .
terrorists and terrorism cannot be eliminated any more than we can rid the world of disease .
there will always be those who will resort to force against innocent men , women , and children in pursuit of political goals .
indeed , terrorists are advancing in some areas .
Pakistan remains a sanctuary for Al Qaeda and some of the world ’ s other most dangerous terrorists .
a mixture of instability , government weakness , and ideology in countries such as Yemen , Libya , Somalia , and Nigeria are providing fertile territory for terrorists to organize , train , and mount operations – much as they did in Afghanistan did a decade ago .
new groups constantly emerge from the ruins of old ones .
there is also a growing danger of homegrown terrorism .
we have seen it in Great Britain and the US .
the Internet , one of the great inventions of the modern Western world , has shown itself to be a weapon that can be used to incite and train those who wish to cause harm to that world .
but even small terrorist successes are costly in terms of lives , money , and making open societies less so .
what is to be done ?
alas , there is no single or silver bullet .
the establishment of a Palestinian state will not be enough for those terrorists who want to see the elimination of the Jewish state , any more than reaching a compromise over Kashmir will satisfy those Pakistan-based terrorists with bigger agendas vis-à-vis India .
reducing unemployment is desirable , of course , but many terrorists do not come from poverty .
helping to make societies in the Middle East and elsewhere more democratic might reduce the alienation that can lead to radicalism and worse , but this is easier said than done .
of course , we want to continue to find ways to make ourselves less vulnerable and terrorists more so .
but what may be most important , particularly in the Arab and Islamic communities , is to end any acceptance of terrorism .
the Nigerian father who warned the US embassy in Lagos that he feared what his own son might do – before that same young man attempted to detonate a bomb aboard a flight to Detroit on Christmas Day 2009 – is an example of just this .
only when more parents , teachers , and community leaders behave likewise will recruitment of terrorists dry up and law-enforcement authorities receive full cooperation from the populations they police .
terrorism must lose its legitimacy among those who have historically supported or tolerated it before it will lose its potency .
the world has tried with little success to cut carbon emissions under the Kyoto Protocol .
the enormous effort expended to bring the Protocol into force nonetheless indicates how much work will be required to produce the next treaty , due to be agreed in Copenhagen in December 2009 .
campaigners will push for tough and far-reaching policies , but strong resistance will continue from countries concerned about their economic vitality .
the new negotiations will have one advantage over the earlier efforts , because governments now understand the need for a portfolio of adaptation , mitigation , and research efforts .
new research that my colleagues and I undertook for the Copenhagen Consensus Center in Denmark explores the effectiveness of different responses to this global challenge , but it strongly supports the portfolio approach for several reasons .
first , we now know that adaptation will be essential , because temperatures will rise by another 0.6 ° C by 2100 even if greenhouse gas emissions are eliminated tomorrow .
we also know that the impact of climate change will not be evenly distributed across the globe .
in some areas , modestly warmer temperatures could produce higher crop yields if associated changes in precipitation patterns are not adverse and / or irrigation remains viable .
even with 0.6 ° C warming , however , Africa and South Asia will experience almost immediate reductions in the viability of many crops and , eventually , increased vulnerability to infectious disease .
these impacts will clearly hit the planet ’ s worst-off inhabitants hardest : the “ bottom billion ” who already bear the heaviest burden of disease , poverty , conflict and malnutrition . &amp; # 160 ;
ensuring that adaptive capacity is expanded and exploited where it is most needed is thus a key challenge .
long-term development may give countries more capacity to soften the impact of climate change on the environment and citizens ’ health , but in the meantime the planet ’ s poorest people will need help from the rich .
our analysis investigated , for example , the merits of more targeted policies for the near term : purchasing mosquito-resistant bed nets and oral re-hydration malaria therapy for children in the poorest nations affected by climate change .
the goal was to deal aggressively and proactively with some of the marginal health impacts of global warming .
benefits would appear almost immediately , but would dissipate over time as economies developed .
even as development improves conditions , however , reducing carbon emissions would become increasingly important over the longer term as the impact of climate change become more severe .
since the effects of climate change have been observed in many areas around the world , thinking about mitigation makes sense everywhere .
but we found that mitigationalone did not meet a standard cost-benefit test .
we allowed specified annual costs of climate policy to grow in proportion with global GDP through 2100 from an initial annual benchmark of $ 18 billion .
the discounted cost of the resulting stream of fixed annual costs totaled $ 800 billion , but damages avoided by this approach amounted to a discounted value of only $ 685 billion .
the Copenhagen Consensus study also examined a portfolio option of the sort heralded by the United Nations ’ Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change .
we allocated $ 50 billion to research into greener technology , so that only $ 750 billion could be absorbed by the economic cost of adaptation and mitigation .
the gap between the cost of carbon-free and carbon-emitting technology fell , and the taxes designed to mitigate emissions became more effective .
as a result , the research and development program essentially paid for itself , and total discounted benefits for the $ 800 billion investment climbed to more than $ 2.1 trillion . &amp; # 160 ;
ensuring that research and development is part of the world ’ s climate change response portfolio would make mitigation efforts more efficient and significantly enhance their ability to reduce carbon emissions over the next century .
but these favorable net benefits reflect very conservative assumptions regarding the timing of emissions reductions and when the developing world would “ come onboard . ”
optimizing investment in the portfolio over time would , for example , increase the discounted benefits by more than a factor of three .
expected benefits would increase further if we included the chance that potentially higher climate sensitivities would exacerbate damages , even though doing so would require including similarly plausible lower climate sensitivities , which would push in the opposite direction .
fighting climate change can be a sound investment , even though neither mitigation nor adaptation alone will be enough to “ solve ” the problem .
to make a real difference , especially in the near term , the world must combine mitigation and adaptation with increased research and development into carbon-saving and sequestering technology , which in turn requires designing and exploiting market-based incentives .
Stockholm – One year after the war in Georgia of last August , pushing the “ reset ” button on diplomatic relations is a popular endeavor nowadays .
President Barack Obama recently journeyed to Moscow in order to “ reset ” strained United States-Russian ties .
the European Union , though not in need of a “ reset ” because of strained ties with its eastern neighbors , is involved in a deep strategic reconstruction of those relations .
when the EU launched its new “ Eastern Partnership ” in May , the purpose was to promote further integration with the Union ’ s six immediate eastern neighbors – Armenia , Azerbaijan , Belarus , Georgia , Moldova , and Ukraine .
the global financial crisis had made an updated and strengthened policy for the EU ’ s eastern neighborhood an urgent need .
equally important was the fact that all the countries concerned expressed an ambition to move closer to the EU .
the Eastern Partnership – originating from a Polish / Swedish initiative – offers to the six countries a substantial upgrading and deepening of relations with the EU in key areas .
in trade and economic relations , it clearly sets out the objective of establishing deep and comprehensive free-trade areas between the EU and the partner countries .
it confirms full visa liberalization as a long-term goal ( with visa facilitation agreements in the meantime ) , promises enhanced cooperation on energy security , diversification , and efficiency , and comes with dedicated programs and projects to help the neighbors in their integration and reform efforts in all these areas .
Sweden ’ s assumption of the EU Presidency this month should help these efforts .
however , it comes at a time when the Union ’ s eastern neighborhood faces severe challenges , with the financial and economic crisis hitting many of the partner countries hard .
Ukraine suffers from the sharp drop in global demand and trade , severely undermining its steel industry .
Georgia ’ s economic success has been largely dependent on direct foreign investment , for which there is hardly any appetite today .
partner countries that are less integrated into the global market , such as Moldova , have seen the crisis arrive more slowly , but the real effect might be equally as bad , and they are likely to recover more slowly .
the Eastern Partnership does not offer any quick remedies to the crisis .
but it can provide a political framework and institution-building support to improve the deficiencies that made these countries so vulnerable to the crisis : imperfect market economies , weak state institutions , and continued corruption .
the Eastern Partnership ’ s offer of deep integration with the EU in the areas such as trade and energy carries with it considerable transformational power .
the other type of crisis that most of the partner countries are enduring is political .
in most of these countries , democratic development has not yet reached a point where a change in government is a routine part of political life and can take place without risking the country ’ s stability .
the Eastern Partnership is based on the profound values of democracy , human rights , and the rule of law .
political association with the EU , and the process of integration under this Partnership , will promote reforms in these key areas .
the Swedish EU Presidency will concentrate on starting up the concrete work – the nuts and bolts – of the Partnership .
the establishment of “ Comprehensive Institution-Building Programs , ” designed to support reform of key institutions in each partner country , should take place before the year ’ s end .
some flagship initiatives proposed by the European Commission will finally see the light of day as well , and new projects and initiatives are likely to be developed .
here , Sweden will attach particular importance to energy efficiency programs , which will serve not only the purposes of enhancing energy security and reducing costs , but will also be an important contribution to the fight against climate change .
the Swedish Presidency , together with the European Commission , intends to organize the first meeting of the Eastern Partnership Civil Society Forum this autumn .
we hope to see the start of parliamentary cooperation , as well as exchanges between local and regional authorities of the thirty-three EU and partner countries .
at the end of the year , a meeting of EU foreign ministers and their colleagues from the six partners will assess the progress made so far and give guidance on the way ahead .
the Eastern Partnership is about EU integration , about the six countries moving closer to the EU ’ s values , legislation , and ways of working , and about the EU being there to support and help this convergence .
in Russia , there is a perception that is sometimes fostered which suggests that the Partnership is directed against it .
but this , of course , is untrue .
on the contrary , Russia , like Turkey , will be welcome to take part in relevant activities within the Partnership ’ s multilateral dimensions .
the Eastern Partnership is not an answer to all the problems and difficulties that the six partners are facing .
nevertheless , it does represent a clear commitment by the EU to lend its political and economic support to their transition and reform – a process that should bring prosperity and stability to the whole region .
Paris – “ Let ’ s engage Russia if we can , but contain it if we must . ”
these two alternatives already defined Western strategy toward Russia in the mid-1990 ’ s .
since then , Russia may have changed dramatically , but not our questions about it .
what do you do when your big neighbor widens the gap that exists between its culture , which is European , and its political system , which is becoming increasingly “ Asian , ” at least in the bad old sense of “ Oriental despotism ” ?
should the best answer to the return of Russia ’ s imperial ambitions be a modern version of a Holy Alliance of stability designed to contain the world ’ s new maverick ?
or is a latter-day Yalta Conference , aimed at redrawing the political boundaries of Europe , necessary ?
could the answer be a bit of both ?
if Russia is becoming what revolutionary France was under Napoleon , or reverting to Soviet form – shorn of a totalitarian ideology but with an appetite for conquest and re-conquest – what is needed is not the “ league of democracies ” advocated by some conservatives in America .
what is needed , instead , is a “ stability league ” that includes prominent actors like China , India , and other countries that are more interested in economic growth than in “ rocking the boat ” of the international system .
such a strategy implies , first of all , a solid partnership with China , not because it is evolving in the direction of democracy , but because it is a status-quo power .
such a strategy could lead to the opening of negotiations with Iran , and of course to a further closing of ranks within NATO .
the message to the Kremlin here would be crystal clear .
“ Do not fool yourself . nationalism and imperialism will lead you nowhere ; you cannot expand geographically without serious costs to your economic growth and your personal enrichment .
Europe may be weak and divided , America may no longer be what it was , but with your falling population and the sad state of your economy beyond oil and gas , you simply are not equipped to be in the league of great global powers . China is ; you are not . ”
but the containment argument fails , because the Kremlin can still make mischief around the world by acting with Syria or Venezuela in an irresponsible manner .
more importantly , rallying the world solely against Russia would mean taking Russia ’ s great power pretensions too seriously .
for example , many Asians believe that Russia is a problem for Europe , but no longer for the world .
at the Cold War ’ s end , Japan remained obsessed with Russia as the heir to the Soviet Union .
today , the Japanese are so concerned with China that they have little time for fears about Russia .
the other alternative to a rebirth of “ containment ” would consist in accepting the Russian argument , or more precisely , Russian “ emotions . ”
it would mean saying , in effect , “ We have unnecessarily humiliated you over the last ten years .
from NATO enlargement to the grant of independence to Kosovo , we have deliberately ignored your sensitivities and your interests .
let ’ s sit down together like Churchill , Roosevelt , and Stalin at Yalta and redesign a twenty-first-century map of Europe .
what do you want back ?
what do we keep ? ”
this approach might recognize Russia ’ s droit de regard on the future evolution of the Caucasus .
indeed , while talking tough under the guidance of Nicolas Sarkozy ’ s France , which currently holds the EU presidency , Europe has de facto resigned itself to Georgia ’ s dismemberment .
Russian troops are to remain in South Ossetia and Abkhazia .
the West is not about to declare war on Russia for the sake of a Georgia whose credibility has been greatly eroded by its president ’ s irresponsible behavior .
as for Ukraine , it may one day become part of the European Union , but its future is not in NATO .
yet , between all-out containment , which is very unlikely and not necessarily desirable or realistic , and accommodation which borders on appeasement , which would be dangerous for Europe ’ s future , a third way , based on a few firm principles , must be found .
these principles are clear . first , Ukraine ’ s territorial integrity is not negotiable .
this has been said many times , but repetition does not diminish its importance .
Russia without Ukraine is a manageable nation-state ; Russia with Ukraine is an unmanageable empire .
second , even if the West condemns Georgia ’ s irresponsibility and incorporates into its policy Russia ’ s sensitivities on the complex historical feelings related to its ex-imperial territories , the Kremlin ’ s shameless brutality is unacceptable .
after all , this is Europe more than six decades after World War II , and nearly 20 years after the collapse of the Soviet Union . the use of force to settle scores and impose one nation ’ s will upon another cannot be accepted passively .
in the short term , time may be on Russia ’ s side .
in the long run – economically , demographically , politically , strategically – time is on “ our ” side , if we stick to our values and our principles .
the drubbing that many governments suffered in the recent elections to the European Union Parliament places them in a difficult position as they maneuver ahead of this week &apos;s EU Summit .
only an incurable optimist can hope that the summit will bring glory to any of them .
the summit has two purposes : to finalize the text of a new EU Constitution , and to appoint the next President of the Commission .
these negotiations will be much harder in view of the spectacular repudiation of a number of key governments at the ballot box , together with the potent rise of protest and Euroskeptic parties in several member states .
the problem for Europe &apos;s leaders is that their own repudiation by voters does not necessarily carry the same message as the rise of the Euroskeptic parties .
the record slump in the vote for Gerhard Schröder &apos;s governing Social Democrats in Germany has little to do with his policy towards Europe , but a great deal to do with the perceived failure of his economic policies - and the persistence of low growth and high unemployment - at home .
despite nationalist parties &apos; success in France , the same is true of the setback for President Jacques Chirac &apos;s centre-right party .
in Britain , by contrast , where the economy is strong and unemployment low , the main factor behind the collapse in the vote for the governing Labor Party has been anger with Tony Blair &apos;s determination to go to war in Iraq beside George Bush .
nevertheless , the rise of Euroskeptic parties , in a number of countries including Britain , France , Belgium , Poland , and the Czech Republic , has worrying implications for a summit meeting whose purpose is to take European integration a small but unmistakable step forward .
in Britain , in particular , the spectacular surge of the UK Independence Party ( UKIP ) can only strengthen the government &apos;s long-standing latent Euroskepticism .
the proposed constitution will contain a Charter of Fundamental Rights , which is intended to enhance the political and moral legitimacy of the EU .
but will it really enhance the rights of EU citizens ?
or , as the British government insists , will it merely be a declaratory document that only describes rights already existing under national legislation in the member states .
the draft constitution would enhance the policymaking powers of the Union , with a bit more majority voting in the Council of Ministers , and a stronger role for the European Parliament .
but , despite Tony Blair &apos;s one-time declaration that he would take Britain &quot; into the heart of Europe , &quot; he remains viscerally opposed to the prospect of further integration , and he will resist any new encroachment on British sovereignty in his &quot; red line &quot; areas of tax , foreign policy , and EU budget finance .
Blair &apos;s Euroskepticism is understandable insofar as it chimes with the British mood .
opinion polls consistently show that British voters are unenthusiastic about the EU , and the picture is confirmed by the latest Eurobarometer poll , conducted throughout the Union for the Commission - but before the recent enlargement from 15 to 25 member states .
one question always asked in this poll is whether voters tend to trust or mistrust different institutions , such as national parliaments , national governments , and the European Union .
overall , the general level of trust in the European Union is not high : only 41 % of voters tend to trust the EU , whereas 42 % tend not to trust it .
but in Britain , the figures are dramatically different : only 19 % trust the EU , while 55 % distrust it .
by contrast , the European Parliament has a better reputation than the EU as a whole : the average EU-wide level of trust in the European Parliament is 54 % , whereas in Britain it is 30 % .
across the EU , 48 % think EU membership is a good thing ; in Britain , this figure falls to 29 % .
on virtually every question , British voters are less enthusiastic about the EU than voters in any other country .
one might think that Britons &apos; aversion to the EU would be reflected in support for , and pride in , their national institutions . not so .
British trust in the European Parliament may stand at only 30 % ; but trust in the Westminster Parliament is much lower , at only 19 % - the lowest figure in the EU .
trust in the national government is a bit higher , but still only 25 % , while trust in national political parties is only 10 % .
both figures are , again , the lowest in the EU .
voters in other states have more confidence in EU institutions , but their opinion of their own institutions is also low . in France , 57 % trust the European Parliament , but only 29 % trust the French parliament ; while the corresponding figures for Germany are 51 % and 23 % .
but the puzzle in the poll is that , even if Europe &apos;s voters are unenthusiastic about the EU and its existing institutions as they stand now , 65 % of them would support a common foreign policy for Europe , and 72 % would support a common defense and security policy ; even in Britain , there is 52 % support for the idea of a common defense policy .
this may be a reaction to the American-led war in Iraq ; but Tony Blair will exclude it precisely for that reason , and a common European defense policy without Britain makes little sense .
the predicament for Europe &apos;s leaders at this week &apos;s summit is that they stand at the cusp of an unstable process of European integration .
with the accession of 10 new members , the EU must become more integrated if it is to function .
but it is not at all clear that those governments that would normally support more integration can sell it to their disillusioned electorates .
Tony Blair has promised a referendum on the new EU constitution , which he cannot possibly win .
the central question will be whether Europe &apos;s &quot; leaders &quot; deliberately play for failure , in the hope that the problem will go away .
Washington , DC – The painfully negotiated US budget legislation that President Barack Obama signed on August 2 combines an increase in America ’ s government debt ceiling with reductions in federal spending , thus averting the prospect of the first default in the 224-year history of the United States .
but the agreement has three major flaws .
two of them offset each other , but the third threatens what America needs most in the coming years : economic growth .
the first flaw is that the spending reductions are badly timed : coming as they do when the US economy is weak , they risk triggering another recession .
the measure ’ s second shortcoming , however , is that the spending reductions that it mandates are modest .
while the legislation does too little to address America ’ s problem of chronic and rising budget deficits , the damage that it inflicts on the economy in the short term is likely to be limited .
the third and most damaging flaw , however , is that the spending cuts come in the wrong places .
because the Democrats in Congress have an almost religious commitment to preserving , intact , America ’ s principal welfare programs for senior citizens , Social Security and Medicare , the legislation does not touch either of them .
these programs ’ costs will rise sharply as the 78-million-strong baby-boom generation – those born between 1946 and 1964 – retires and collects benefits , accounting for the largest increase in government spending and prospective deficits in the years ahead .
and , because the Republicans in Congress have an equally strong allergy to raising any taxes , any time , under any circumstances , the bill does not rely at all on tax increases – not even for the wealthiest Americans – for the deficit reduction that it provides .
all of the spending cuts come from the “ discretionary ” part of the federal budget , which excludes Social Security , Medicare , the Medicaid program for the poor , and interest on the national debt .
that leaves only about one-third of total federal spending from which to cut , and much of that goes to the defense budget , which Republicans will attempt to protect in the future .
so the structure established by the August 2 law concentrates deficit reduction on the “ discretionary non-defense ” part of the federal budget , which is only about 10 % of it .
this is too small a pool of money from which to achieve deficit reduction on the scale that the US will need in the years ahead .
worse yet , discretionary non-defense spending includes programs that are indispensable for economic growth – and economic growth is indispensable for America ’ s future prosperity and global standing .
growth is , in the first place , the best way to reduce the country ’ s budget deficits .
the higher the growth rate , the more revenues the government will collect without raising tax rates ; and higher revenues enable smaller deficits .
moreover , economic growth is necessary to keep the promise – enormously important to individual Americans – that each generation will have the opportunity to become more prosperous than the preceding one , the popular term for which is “ the American dream . ”
just as important for non-Americans , only robust economic growth can ensure that the US sustains its expansive role in the world , which supports the global economy and contributes to stability in Europe , East Asia , and the Middle East .
the first three elements of the American formula for growth cost money , and that money is included in the “ discretionary non-defense ” part of the federal budget now targeted by the debt-ceiling legislation .
cutting these programs will lower American economic growth in the long term , with negative consequences both at home and abroad .
reducing the deficit by cutting funds for education , infrastructure , and research and development is akin to trying to lose weight by cutting off three fingers . most of the weight will remain , and one ’ s life prospects will have worsened significantly .
reducing deficits in order to raise the debt ceiling was the right thing to do , but the August 2 law does it in the wrong way .
unless more deficit reduction , which is inevitable , comes from curbing entitlement benefits and increasing revenues , and less from programs vital for economic growth , the result will be a poorer , weaker US – and a more uncertain , if not unstable , world .
to many , myself included , NATO &apos;s enlargement to take in , among others , the Baltic states of Estonia , Latvia , and Lithuania -- which were once Soviet republics -- is an impossible dream come true .
when the idea was first floated some 10 years ago , expansion into the Baltics was taken seriously by few people .
until recently , Russia &apos;s robust opposition to the idea posed a serious obstacle , because it sharpened the impression that Russia regarded its so-called &quot; near abroad &quot; as a zone of special interest and influence .
NATO &apos;s enlargement makes it crystal clear that no country in the new Europe can be regarded as part of another country &apos;s &quot; zone . &quot;
it assures the three small Baltic countries that the nightmare of occupation by big neighbors ( Hitler &apos;s Reich and Stalin &apos;s USSR ) , which they endured for half-a-century -- will not be repeated .
by putting paid to any revanchist tendencies in Russia concerning the Baltics , Europe is made a safer place , and Russia is helped in its effort to redefine itself as a national state and not an empire .
expansion will also create a better Europe because enlargement widens the territory in which countries are committed to NATO &apos;s political values , including individual rights as well as the rights of minorities .
fortunately Russia now seems to grasp the value of this political aspect of NATO-enlargement .
rightly so : enlargement of NATO is not an &quot; expansion &quot; that threatens Russia or other countries which strive for democratic political reforms .
on the contrary , expansion takes away the worries - be they real or imagined - that surround the situation of the large Russian-speaking populations that now live outside of Russia but within the borders of the former Soviet Union .
the civil rights of the Russian minorities in the Baltics and elsewhere are now enshrined in law , due in no small part to NATO demands .
those civil rights initiatives on the part of NATO reflect the increasingly workmanlike way that Russia , Europe , and America now work out their disagreements .
indeed , enlargement of NATO comes only a few days after a deal was struck between Russia and the EU on the tricky question of access to the Russian enclave of Kaliningrad .
this small piece of Russia , with 1 million inhabitants and bordering on the Baltic Sea , is squeezed between Poland and Lithuania , two future members of the EU .
this could have incited a complicated situation where Russians were faced with tough visa requirements when travelling between Kaliningrad and Russia proper .
a deal was struck between President Putin and the EU that makes access much easier without compromising the status of Lithuania and Poland within the EU-regime .
this , in turn , created once again the kind of win-win situation that is so important for future relations between the EU and Russia .
when the enlargement of the EU into Central and Eastern Europe is finally decided by the European Council in Copenhagen next month , the conclusion is clear : Europe has become a much better and safer place to live in , thanks to the decisions taken by NATO and the EU during the crucial autumn of 2002 .
but this is no cause for complacency . for the really hard work is only now beginning : dealing with all the internal practical and political problems that these enlargements will bring , as well as reckoning with countries in the membership waiting rooms , in particular Russia .
relations with Russia are of vital importance if Europe is to continue to improve the quality of life of its citizens and address concerns of safety .
the common threat of international terrorism must be faced jointly .
we need to convince each other that the fight against this common enemy has to be fought with a keen eye to balancing the needs of security with those of human and minority rights .
Kaliningrad could be a litmus test of these relations .
the first hurdle has been overcome with the agreement on access to the enclave .
the next hurdle is to support Kalingrad &apos;s fight against disease and crime as well as strengthening its economic and social structures .
this calls for generosity from the EU and flexibility from Moscow .
in a wider context this could lead to a strengthening of the so-called Northern Dimension of the EU , where the goal is a free trade area to include all the countries around the Baltic Sea .
such a grand project can be achieved if the political will exists and asserts itself .
only a few years ago EU and NATO enlargement were regarded as wild dreams .
but determination and political will has now made the dreams come true .
now is the time to set new ambitious goals for Europe .
in 1977 , when I served in President Jimmy Carter &apos;s State Department , I was sent to India to dissuade that country &apos;s leaders from developing a nuclear bomb .
my hosts replied that they needed to keep up with China .
I said that Pakistan would inevitably follow suit and the world would become less safe .
India promised that it would not export its weapons technology .
so far as we know , its leaders have kept their word .
but revelations about the nuclear weapons smuggling network organized by A. Q. Khan , the father of Pakistan &apos;s bomb , confirm the danger I predicted back then .
some call Khan &apos;s network an effort to spread an &quot; Islamic bomb , &quot; but given that North Korea was on the list of recipients along with Libya and Iran , it might better be termed a corrupt bomb .
as events in Pakistan illustrate , the spread of nuclear technology does not extend the stability that comes with mutual deterrence .
rather , it increases the prospects of corrupt leakage that may allow terrorist groups access to nuclear weapons .
that makes everyone less safe .
any pathological group of extremists could destroy New Delhi , Tokyo , Paris , or any city they chose .
now the world &apos;s attention is focussed on Iran , one recipient of Pakistani technology , as the country seemingly keenest to create its own nuclear arsenal .
according to the International Atomic Energy Agency ( IAEA ) , Iran began enriching uranium at a pilot centrifuge plant last August , and is constructing larger underground enrichment facilities .
Iran proclaims that its programs are for peaceful generation of nuclear energy , but inspectors have already found traces of highly enriched weapons-grade uranium .
last October , Mohamed El Baradei , the head of the IAEA , announced that Iran had accepted enhanced inspection procedures .
in addition , after visits by the French , British , and German foreign ministers , Iran announced a temporary suspension of its enrichment program .
now it hints that it may resume enrichment , and recent press reports about the imports from Pakistan suggest Iran failed to disclose everything to the IAEA .
Iran claims that as a party to the Non-Proliferation Treaty , it has the right to enrich uranium for peaceful purposes .
correct , because the NPT was born with a loophole .
even if a country agrees to broad ranging IAEA inspections , it can legally accumulate enriched uranium ( or reprocessed plutonium ) under the guise of a peaceful energy program , and then suddenly declare that circumstances have changed and withdraw from the treaty - with the ability to produce nuclear weapons on short notice .
if Iran did this , it would not only add to the dangers in an unstable region , but would likely begin a process of unravelling the non-proliferation regime worldwide .
Iran may ask what right others have to demand that it forego nuclear weapons .
the answer lies both in the fact that it promised not to do so when it signed the NPT and in the consequences that it would impose on others .
for these reasons , President Bush declared an Iranian nuclear weapon unacceptable .
however , America &apos;s unilateral options are limited .
not only is the US military busy trying in Iraq , but the way the US went into Iraq - which proved to have fewer nuclear capabilities than Iran - undermined American credibility , making it difficult to recruit allies to contain Iran &apos;s nuclear ambitions .
fortunately , there is a multilateral option and an existing precedent . in the mid-1970 &apos;s , many parties to the NPT planned to import and develop enrichment and reprocessing facilities .
realizing the threat to the non-proliferation regime , countries as diverse as the Soviet Union , France , Germany , and Japan formed a &quot; Nuclear Suppliers Group &quot; that restrained the export of enrichment and reprocessing facilities .
that plugged part of the loophole in the treaty without amending it .
today , such countries should join together to offer Iran ( and others ) a deal .
countries that wish to develop nuclear energy but not nuclear bombs should be given international guarantees of fuel supply and disposal of spent fuel .
for example , Russia , which is helping Iran construct a nuclear reactor at Bushehr , should offer Iran a guarantee of low enriched uranium fuel and reprocessing of the reactor &apos;s spent fuel by sending it back to Russia if Iran agrees to forego enrichment and reprocessing .
this deal could then be given teeth by the UN Security Council .
the Council would declare that further proliferation of nuclear weapons is a threat to peace , and that any country moving in that direction is subject to sanctions .
such a resolution would also include a carrot by guaranteeing Iran access to the non-dangerous parts of the nuclear energy fuel cycle .
the pot could be further sweetened by offers to relax existing sanctions and provide a security guarantee if Iran remains non-nuclear .
European foreign ministers have already expressed their concerns about Iran &apos;s nuclear program .
Russia indicates that it is willing to provide such fuel services .
it is time for the Security Council to try to internationalize the most dangerous parts of the nuclear fuel cycle .
it is not too late to learn the lessons of the misadventures of A. Q. Khan .
new YORK – The G-8 ’ s $ 20 billion initiative on smallholder agriculture , launched at the group ’ s recent summit in L ’ Aquila , Italy , is a potentially historic breakthrough in the fight against hunger and extreme poverty .
with serious management of the new funds , food production in Africa will soar .
indeed , the new initiative , combined with others in health , education , and infrastructure , could be the greatest step so far toward achieving the Millennium Development Goals , the internationally agreed effort to reduce extreme poverty , disease , and hunger by half by 2015 .
during 2002-2006 , I led the United Nations Millennium Project , which aimed to achieve the Millennium Development Goals , for then-UN Secretary General Kofi Annan .
one cornerstone of the project was “ smallholder farmers , ” meaning peasant farm families in Africa , Latin America , and Asia – working farms of around one hectare ( 2.5 acres ) or less .
these are some of the poorest households in the world , and , ironically , some of the hungriest as well , despite being food producers .
they are hungry because they lack the ability to buy high-yield seeds , fertilizer , irrigation equipment , and other tools needed to increase productivity .
as a result , their output is meager and insufficient for their subsistence .
their poverty causes low farm productivity , and low farm productivity reinforces their poverty .
it ’ s a vicious circle , technically known as a poverty trap .
the UN Millennium Project ’ s Hunger Task Force , led by two world-leading scientists , M. S. Swaminathan and Pedro Sanchez , examined how to break this vicious circle .
the Hunger Task Force determined that Africa could substantially increase its food production if help was given to smallholder farmers , in the form of agricultural inputs . the Millennium Project recommended a big increase in global funding for this purpose . drawing on that work and related scientific findings , Annan launched a call in 2004 for an African Green Revolution , based on an expanded partnership between Africa and donor countries .
many of us , notably current UN Secretary General Ban Ki-moon , have worked hard to make this possible , with Ban repeatedly emphasizing the special emergency arising from the global food , financial , and energy crises of the past two years .
the G-8 announcement reflects these years of effort , and of course the boost from the leadership of US President Barack Obama , Spanish Prime Minister Jose Luis Zapatero , Australian Prime Minister Kevin Rudd , World Bank President Robert Zoellick , European Commissioner Louis Michel , European Parliamentarian Thijs Berman , and others .
now the key is to make this effort work .
the lessons of history are clear .
getting seed and fertilizer to smallholder farmers at highly subsidized prices ( or even free in some cases ) will make a lasting difference .
not only will food yields rise in the short term , but farm households will use their higher incomes and better health to accumulate all sorts of assets : cash balances , soil nutrients , farm animals , and their children ’ s health and education .
that boost in assets will , in turn , enable local credit markets , such as micro-finance , to begin operating .
farmers will be able to buy inputs , either out of their own cash , or by borrowing against their improved creditworthiness .
a consensus has now been reached on the need to assist smallholders , but obstacles remain .
perhaps the main risk is that the “ aid bureaucracies ” now trip over each other to try to get their hands on the $ 20 billion , so that much of it gets taken up by meetings , expert consultations , overhead , reports , and further meetings .
“ Partnerships ” of donors can become an expensive end in themselves , merely delaying real action .
if donor governments really want results , they should take the money out of the hands of thirty or more separate aid bureaucracies and pool it in one or two places , the most logical being the World Bank in Washington and the International Fund for Agricultural Development ( IFAD ) in Rome .
one or both of these agencies would then have an account with several billion dollars .
governments in hunger-stricken regions , especially Africa , would then submit national action plans that would provide details on how they would use the donor funds to get high-yield seeds , fertilizer , irrigation , farm tools , storage silos , and local advice to impoverished farmers .
an independent expert panel would review the national plans to verify their scientific and managerial coherence .
assuming that a plan passes muster , the money to support it would quickly be disbursed .
afterward , each national program would be monitored , audited , and evaluated .
this approach is straightforward , efficient , accountable , and scientifically sound .
two major recent success stories in aid have used this approach : the Global Alliance on Vaccines and Immunizations , which successfully gets immunizations to young children , and the Global Fund to Fight AIDS , TB , and Malaria , which supports national action plans to battle these killer diseases .
both have saved millions of lives during the past decade , and have paved the way to a new more efficient and scientifically sound method of development assistance .
not surprisingly , many UN agencies and aid agencies in rich countries fight this approach .
all too often , the fight is about turf , rather than about the most effective way to speed help to the poor .
Obama , Rudd , Zapatero , and other forward-thinking leaders can therefore make a huge difference by following up on their pledges at the G-8 and insisting that the aid really works .
the bureaucracies must be bypassed to get help to where it is needed : in the soil tilled by the world ’ s poorest farm families .
new YORK – In the afternoon of July 16 two men appeared to be breaking into a fine house in an expensive area of Cambridge , Massachusetts .
alerted by a telephone call , a policeman arrived smartly on the scene .
he saw one black male standing inside the house and asked him to come out .
the man refused .
he was then told to identify himself .
the man , still refusing to step out , said he was a Harvard professor , showed his ID , and warned the cop not to mess with him .
he said something about black men in America being singled out , and asked the cop , who was white , for his name and identification .
the cop , joined by several colleagues , arrested the professor for disorderly conduct .
we now know that the professor had broken into his own home , with the help of his chauffeur , because the door was jammed .
what was unusual here was not the cop ’ s heavy-handedness .
most people in the US know that if you talk back to the police , they will get nasty very fast .
the fact that the man was black might or might not have made the cop go for his handcuffs even sooner than he might normally have done .
that , too , would not have been unusual .
what made this case special was that Henry Louis “ Skip ” Gates is one of the most celebrated professors in the country , famous for his books , his articles , and numerous television appearances .
he is a grandee , a mover and shaker in the academic and media world , a friend of President Barack Obama .
that is why he warned the cop , Sgt. James Crowley , a veteran of the Cambridge police force , not to mess with him .
class and race overlap in the US .
in this instance , it is impossible to pry them apart .
Gates , deeply conscious , indeed a specialist of the terrible history of race relations in his country , instinctively assumed that he was a victim of prejudice .
from his words it appears that he was equally conscious of not getting the proper respect due to a distinguished Harvard professor and media celebrity .
as he put it to his daughter in an interview published online : “ &#91; Crowley &#93; should have gotten out of there and said , ‘ I ’ m sorry , sir , good luck .
loved your &#91; television &#93; series — check with you later ! ’ ”
alas , Sgt.Crowley had never heard of Professor Gates .
a local man whose brothers all serve in the police force , a sports fan , and an amateur basketball coach , Crowley does not move in the same social circles as Gates .
as it happens , the charges were duly dropped , and there the case might have rested if President Obama , tired and frustrated after weeks of fighting for his healthcare bill , had not weighed in on behalf of his “ friend ” Gates , and called the police “ stupid . ”
both he and Gates then spoke of “ learning ” from the incident .
Gates might even be planning a television documentary on racial profiling .
one thing to be learned , if we didn ’ t know this already , is how close racial sensitivities are to the surface of US life , despite the election of a black president .
the complexities of black anger , white guilt , and of black , and white fear , are so vexed that most Americans prefer not to talk about race at all .
the field is too full of mines .
one of Obama ’ s great achievements is that he made it into a serious topic through the brilliance and subtlety of his rhetoric .
and there remains plenty to talk about : the grotesquely disproportionate number of black men in US prisons ; the lack of educational opportunities in poor , mostly black areas ; the appalling healthcare system ; and the very real brutality used by police officers against blacks , who don ’ t have the privilege of a Harvard ID .
it is probably true that many white policemen , even if they are trained to avoid racial profiling , as Sgt. Crowley was , need to be convinced that a black man can be at home in one of the finer houses of Cambridge , or any other American city .
but is the Gates affair the right way to enter into this discussion ?
one might argue that itwas .
if not Professor Gates , then who ?
precisely because he is a grandee , he is in the position to draw national attention to a serious issue .
if the same thing had happened to an unknown man in Harlem , or some other poor , or predominantly black district , no one would ever have heard about it .
the fact that it happened to a professor in Cambridge makes everyone sit up and take notice .
there is , however , a danger that it will have an adverse affect on the necessary national discussion about race .
by having made such a big issue out of what was in fact a relatively minor event Gates could be accused of trivializing much worse instances of abuse .
indeed , we don ’ t even know for certain whether this was such an instance .
Crowley never mentioned the color of Gates ’ skin .
there was no question of violence .
there were just very raw nerves and hypersensitivity to hints of disrespect , on the part of the professor , and of the cop .
outrage about a professor who is not to be messed with is not the best way to discuss the plight of countless , poor , anonymous people , whom most of us find it too easy to ignore .
Berlin – Twenty-five years after the nuclear disaster at Chernobyl , the ongoing catastrophe at the Fukushima nuclear reactor in Japan has – it must be hoped – made clear once and for all that the purported blessings of the nuclear age are mere illusions : nuclear power is neither clean nor safe nor cheap .
indeed , the opposite is true .
nuclear power is saddled with three major unresolved risks : plant safety , nuclear waste , and , most menacing of all , the risk of military proliferation .
moreover , the alternatives to nuclear energy – and to fossil fuels – are well known and technically much more advanced and sustainable .
taking on nuclear risk is not a necessity ; it is a deliberate political choice .
fossil-fuel and nuclear energy belong to the technological utopias of the nineteenth and twentieth centuries , which were based on a belief in the innocence of the technologically feasible and on the fact that , at the time , only a minority of people worldwide , largely in the West , benefited from technological progress .
by contrast , the twenty-first century will be informed by the realization that the global ecosystem and its resources , which are indispensable for human survival , are finite , and that this implies an enduring responsibility to preserve what we have .
meeting this imperative entails both an enormous technological challenge and an opportunity to redefine the meaning of modernity .
the energy future of nine billion people , which is what the world population will be in the middle of the century , lies neither in fossil fuels nor in nuclear energy , but in renewable energy sources and dramatic improvements in energy efficiency .
we already know this .
why , then , do the most advanced countries , in particular , take on the risk of a mega-catastrophe by seeking to create energy from radioactive fission ?
the answer , ultimately , doesn ’ t lie with any civilian use of nuclear energy , but first and foremost with its military applications .
the energy derived from splitting uranium and plutonium atoms was originally used for the ultimate weapon , the atomic bomb .
being a nuclear power provides sovereign states with protection and prestige .
even today , the Bomb divides the world into two classes : the few states have it , and the many that do not .
the old Cold War world order was based on the nuclear arms race between the two superpowers , the United States and Soviet Union .
to stop others from trying to become nuclear powers , which would have multiplied and spread the risk of nuclear confrontation , the Non-Proliferation Treaty ( NPT ) was framed in the 1960 ’ s .
to this day , it governs the relationships between the nuclear powers and the rest of the world , imposing renunciation on the have-nots and nuclear-disarmament obligations on the haves .
of course , the NPT has repeatedly been violated or circumvented by states that never subscribed to it .
to this day , therefore , the risk remains that the number of nuclear powers will increase , particularly given small and medium powers ’ hope to enhance their prestige and position in regional conflicts .
Iran is the most current example of this .
the nuclearization of these not-always-stable states threatens to make the regional conflicts of the twenty-first century much more dangerous , and will also substantially increase the risk that nuclear weapons eventually end up in the hands of terrorists .
despite the NPT , a clear separation between civilian and military use of nuclear energy hasn ’ t always worked , or worked completely , because the NPT ’ s rules permit all signatory states to develop and use – under international supervision – all of the components of the nuclear fuel cycle for civilian purposes .
from here , then , all that is required to become a nuclear power are a few small technical steps and political leaders ’ decision to take them .
this political power , not the requirements of energy policy , is what makes giving up nuclear energy so difficult .
as a rule , the path to nuclear-power status always begins with so-called “ civilian ” nuclear programs .
the supposed “ civilian ” nuclear ambitions of Iran have thus , for instance , led to a large number of such “ civilian ” programs in neighboring states .
Honni soit qui mal y pense !
and , of course , the reactions of the nuclear powers to the disaster at Fukushima will be watched and analyzed closely by the so-called “ clandestine threshold countries . ”
so how will the world – first and foremost , the main nuclear powers – react to the Fukushima disaster ?
will the tide truly turn , propelling the world towards nuclear disarmament and a future free of nuclear weapons ?
or will we witness attempts to downplay the calamity and return to business as usual as soon as possible ?
Fukushima has presented the world with a far-reaching , fundamental choice .
it was Japan , the high-tech country par excellence ( not the latter-day Soviet Union ) that proved unable to take adequate precautions to avert disaster in four reactor blocks .
what , then , will a future risk assessment look like if significantly less organized and developed countries begin – with the active assistance of the nuclear powers – to acquire civilian nuclear-energy capabilities ?
any decision to continue as before would send an unambiguous message to the clandestine threshold countries that are secretly pursuing nuclear weapons : despite lofty rhetoric and wordy documents , the nuclear powers lack the political will to change course .
were they to abandon nuclear energy , however , their epochal change of heart would constitute a seminal contribution to global nuclear security – and thus to the fight against nuclear proliferation .
WAGENINGEN , NETHERLANDS – Born in 1957 , the Common Agricultural Policy ( CAP ) is now more than 50 years old , and the European Commission is proposing what it calls a health check for its middle-aged child .
but superficial repairs will not meet the European Union ’ s future needs .
the CAP must be born again .
work on its renewal is due to start now , with the completed project ready in 2013 .
but a much more profound re-think is needed .
the CAP ’ s original aim was to provide a secure source of food for the six original member states of the Union , which were importers of food and sought a degree of self-sufficiency .
good , healthy , and cheap food had to be accessible for all citizens .
improved agricultural productivity would benefit rural areas and give farmers a comparative share in the Union ’ s growing wealth .
instruments to achieve those objectives were developed , and food security was achieved .
the CAP quickly came to be seen as the jewel in the crown of the European project .
as the EU has evolved and expanded , food systems have become more complex , involving production , processing , supply-chain organization , and wholesale and retail distribution , with all of these involving new issues like health and the environment .
the use of land is also receiving more serious scrutiny .
a 1991 study by the Netherlands Scientific Council for Governmental Policy , entitledGround for Choices , demonstrated that the EU ’ s food supply could be met with 50 % less cultivated land , 80 % less pesticides , and at 50 % less cost .
pollution would be reduced by 70 % as a result of fewer nitrates in the surface water , and greenhouse gases would be cut .
those figures were for an EU of 15 countries , so with today ’ s 27 members the possibilities are even greater .
a Dutch analysis of land use has shown that by employing the best technical and ecological means on the best available land , substantial gains could be made in food production .
so it is not surprising that the number of farmers needed has fallen substantially .
viewed from the standpoint of food security and the wealth of rural areas , there is now an urgent need to revisit the CAP ’ s main instruments so that a new policy formula can be introduced .
perverse subsidies must be removed and recent new ones favoring products such as bio-fuels reconsidered .
Thestatus quo clearly has to be changed .
rural policy in the EU is too often reduced to income guarantees for the farming community .
but that attitude is undermining change .
competition must be encouraged , as more rural entrepreneurship will strengthen the farming community , with fewer farmers but better farms .
a simplified CAP would encourage cleaner , more productive , and efficient agriculture .
a side benefit for the EU ’ s standing in the world could be that the World Trade Organization ’ s stalled Doha negotiations could be restarted once farmers in developing countries are assured of getting a fair deal from Europe .
moreover , the CAP ’ s role as a motor of political and social integration in Europe could be restored once renewed policies are in place .
but renewal of this sort cannot be left to global market forces , as the results might not necessarily benefit European agriculture and society .
if the market “ misbehaves , ” farmers could be reduced to poverty , leading to the neglect of large areas of Europe .
that is a real enough danger to which policymakers must give serious thought as they reform the CAP on the basis of the following five pillars .
1 . &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 160 ; The EU needs a knowledge and innovation policy that strengthens European agriculture ’ s competitiveness .
such a policy has been successful in the Netherlands , substantially contributing to the development and power of the country ’ s agribusiness .
ten of 21 branches of Dutch agribusiness , including horticultural seeds , ornamentals , seed potatoes , and veal , are among the top contributors to the national economy and the country ’ s trade balance .
in the EU as a whole , a policy directed toward research programs stimulating scientific excellence and greater coherence in the European knowledge system would greatly strengthen agriculture ’ s competitiveness and contribute to food security and sustainable development .
2 . &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 160 ; Europe also needs a restructuring policy for land use .
many structural improvement programs have been financed at the European level , but agricultural production and land use are not among them .
the development of an Agricultural Main Structure would compliment the European Ecological Main Structure .
reforestation and the repair of natural ecosystems should also be part of a land use policy .
3 . &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 160 ; A policy for European food systems would treat production , processing , distribution , logistics , and retailing in combination .
consumption patterns and preferences are an integral part of such systems .
preliminary studies by the European Science Foundation ’ s “ Forward Look on European Food Systems ” could prove useful in devising an EU-wide policy .
4 . &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 160 ; Metropolitan agriculture in a rapidly urbanizing world can provide high-quality produce on small amounts of land .
it offers an answer to rising demand for healthy food with minimal environmental side effects .
5 . &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 160 ; A new CAP should include a policy to safeguard Europe ’ s landscapes .
but a cultural heritage should not be maintained everywhere , nor should it ignore cost .
and it should not be a defensive policy of the sort that tends to concentrate on poor-quality land .
these five pillars involve drastic choices , but they will probably require less money from Europe ’ s taxpayers , not more .
they could make a real contribution to cleaner , more productive , and efficient farming and land use , while addressing social needs .
“ It could happen here ” is the shorthand phrase frequently used for a variety of alarming hypothetical scenarios .
“ How could this happen here ? ” was the question more pertinently asked in Great Britain recently , as its universities witnessed the unfolding of an all-too-real and perplexing action .
in early June , the National Association of Teachers in Further and Higher Education ( NATFHE ) , Britain ’ s largest academic union , with 67,000 members , passed a motion to sever ties with all Israeli professors and institutions of higher learning unless they publicly dissociate themselves from “ continuing Israeli apartheid policies . ”
the motion was subsequently revoked ; but the fact that it was put forward at all is astonishing enough .
indeed , the union ’ s call for a wholesale boycott contravened its most fundamental values : the principle of academic freedom , openness , and exchange ; protection of research from state politics ; and the fundamental right to free speech .
the motion implicitly adopted the yardstick of collective punishment and a distinctly McCarthyite tone , demanding a sort of “ disloyalty oath ” from Israeli academics .
what led scholars who are putatively the guardians of democratic freedoms to embrace measures so reminiscent of fascist and Stalinist tactics ?
unfortunately , the NATFHE effort is part of a larger phenomenon .
in 2005 , the Association of University Teachers ( AUT ) called for a more limited boycott , singling out Bar Ilan and Haifa Universities for opprobrium .
before that , a petition , signed by roughly 80 prominent British intellectuals and a few from other European countries , demanded the cessation of European Union funding for Israeli cultural projects and institutions .
these campaigns , encouraged by Palestinian groups and non-governmental organizations , have been accompanied by individual acts of professional ostracism , and an informal boycott of Israeli scholars , publications , and cultural projects already exists in some European circles .
such developments suggest an advanced and deeply disturbing trend , whereby certain segments of the European intelligentsia are willing to violate their own beliefs in order to target one state for unique stigmatization ; and whereby insidious and sometimes illegal forms of discrimination against that state ’ s citizens are increasingly seen as acceptable .
in a certain ideological mind-set , Israel is perceived not as a political entity , susceptible to prevailing standards of judgment , but as an almost allegorical force , the symbolic center and source of the globe ’ s evils and ailments .
of course , Israel has been guilty of both bad policies and political sins .
the occupation of Palestinian territories has had terrible consequences , and it is necessary to end it .
but in today ’ s intensely charged climate , the Middle East has become a kind of ideological projection screen , a magnet for tendencies to demonization and idealization .
in the putatively “ radical ” interpretation , the relationship between Israel and the Palestinians is rarely seen as a conflict between two groups with sometimes tragically opposed interests .
rather , the stubborn complexities of the situation are reduced to a stark struggle between absolute power and absolute powerlessness , the archetypal oppressor and archetypal oppressed .
the rhetoric applied to Israel becomes ever more extreme , and conducive to hatred .
phrases like “ apartheid state ” and “ Zionism is racism , ” unthinkable in liberal discourse a few years ago , have become routine .
at the same time , the Palestinians become objects of romanticized identifications – one of the leaders of the NAFTHE motion was seen , prior to a meeting , draped in a Palestinian flag – and unwitting condescension .
they are seen as the last pure cause , the entirely innocent “ Other , ” unimplicated in their fate and apparently deprived of political agency or choice .
the possibility that the Palestinians are capable of deliberate decisions , that they have adopted policies which may have contributed to the current situation , or that they have exercised their own forms of power and violence , is , in this framework , never admitted .
Hamas was never mentioned in either of the university unions ’ motions .
this is Manicheanism of the left , and , like Manicheanism of the political right , it can distort reality to the point of becoming divorced from it .
certainly , the boycott efforts ignored basic facts .
advocates of discriminatory measures often charge their opponents with stifling legitimate criticism of Israel .
this argument is both disingenuous and dishonest .
many of the boycotts ’ critics are also critical of Israel .
but credible criticism must be based on evidence – and on generally applicable criteria of judgment .
if the British unions wanted to be ethically consistent , they should apply the same strategies to universities in the numerous countries where human rights are brutally abused and free speech suppressed .
some see this hostility to Israel as camouflaging old-fashioned anti-Semitism .
it is always risky to speculate about hidden motives ; nevertheless , systematic disparagement of Israeli society and culture undoubtedly encourages the sense that anti-Semitism , too , is a permitted prejudice .
it is always easier to see a group or nation as a malevolent “ Other ” when this impulse is fed by an old , and still potent , prejudice .
there is a deeper issue at stake .
democratic societies depend not only on the foundational principle of free speech , but on the character of political thought and conversation among various constituencies .
when the supposedly most enlightened and liberal of those constituencies resorts to illiberal discourse and intolerant measures , tendencies toward bigotry and ideological irrationality are reinforced .
the actions of the British academic unions have Israel as their obvious target .
but their main effect may be an erosion of reasoned debate and civil conduct , without which democracy is powerless against the forces of polarization and extremism .
new YORK – Today ’ s world hunger crisis is unprecedentedly severe and requires urgent measures .
nearly one billion people are trapped in chronic hunger – perhaps 100 million more than two years ago .
Spain is taking global leadership in combating hunger by inviting world leaders to Madrid in late January to move beyond words to action .
with Spain ’ s leadership and United Nations Secretary General Ban Ki-moon ’ s partnership , several donor governments are proposing to pool their financial resources so that the world ’ s poorest farmers can grow more food and escape the poverty trap .
the benefits of some donor help can be remarkable .
peasant farmers in Africa , Haiti , and other impoverished regions currently plant their crops without the benefit of high-yield seed varieties and fertilizers .
the result is a grain yield ( for example , maize ) that is roughly one-third less than what could be achieved with better farm inputs .
African farmers produce roughly one ton of grain per hectare , compared with more than four tons per hectare in China , where farmers use fertilizers heavily .
African farmers know that they need fertilizer ; they just can ’ t afford it . with donor help , they can .
not only do these farmers then feed their families , but they also can begin to earn market income and to save for the future .
by building up savings over a few years , the farmers eventually become creditworthy , or have enough cash to purchase vitally necessary inputs on their own .
there is now widespread agreement on the need for increased donor financing for small farmers ( those with two hectares or less of land , or impoverished pastoralists ) , which is especially urgent in Africa .
the UN Secretary General led a steering group last year that determined that African agriculture needs around $ 8 billion per year in donor financing – roughly four times the current total – with a heavy emphasis on improved seeds , fertilizer , irrigation systems , and extension training .
helping the poor with today ’ s technologies , while investing in future improved technologies , is the optimum division of labor .
this investment pays off wonderfully , with research centers such as the International Rice Research Institute and the International Maize and Wheat Improvement Centre providing the high-yield seeds and innovative farming strategies that together triggered the Asian Green Revolution .
these centers are not household names , but they deserve to be .
their scientific breakthroughs have helped to feed the world , and we ’ ll need more of them .
dozens of low-income , food-deficit countries , perhaps as many as 40-50 , have elaborated urgent programs for increased food production by small farms , but are currently held back by the lack of donor funding .
these countries have appealed to the World Bank for financing , and the Bank made a valiant effort in 2008 to help through its new Global Food Crisis Response Program ( GFCRP ) .
but the Bank does not yet have sufficient funds to meet these countries ’ urgent needs , and has had to ration assistance to a small fraction of the flows that could be effectively and reliably used .
hundreds of millions of people , in the meantime , remain trapped in hunger .
many individual donor countries have declared that they are now prepared to increase their financial support for smallholder agriculture , but are searching for the appropriate mechanisms to do so .
the current aid structures are inadequate .
the more than 20 bilateral and multilateral donor agencies for agriculture are highly fragmented and of insufficient scale individually and collectively .
despite the dedicated efforts of many professionals , the response to the hunger crisis remains utterly inadequate .
the 2008 planting seasons came and went with much too little additional help for impoverished small farmers .
African countries search endlessly , and mostly fruitlessly , for the small amounts of funding needed for their purchases of fertilizer and improved seeds .
my colleagues and I , serving on an advisory committee for the Spanish initiative , have recommended that donors pool their funds into a single international account , which we call the Financial Coordination Mechanism ( FCM ) .
these pooled funds would enable farmers in poor countries to obtain the fertilizer , improved seed varieties , and small-scale irrigation equipment that they urgently need .
poor countries would receive prompt and predictable financing for agricultural inputs from a single account , rather than from dozens of distinct and fragmented donors .
by pooling financial resources into a single-donor FCM , aid programs ’ administrative costs could be kept low , the availability of aid flows could be assured , and poor countries would not have to negotiate 25 times in order to receive help .
the time for business as usual is over .
the donors promised to double aid to Africa by 2010 , but are still far off track .
indeed , during the past 20 years , they actually cut aid for agriculture programs , and only now are reversing course .
meanwhile , a billion people go hungry each day .
we need a breakthrough that is demonstrable , public , clear , and convincing , that can mobilize the public ’ s hearts and minds , and that can demonstrate success .
history can be made in Madrid at the end of January , when the world ’ s richest and poorest countries converge to seek solutions to the global hunger crisis .
the lives of the billion poorest people depend on it .
new YORK – Every year , millions of people die from preventable and treatable diseases , especially in poor countries .
in many cases , lifesaving medicines can be cheaply mass-produced , but are sold at prices that block access to those who need them .
and many die simply because there are no cures or vaccines , because so little of the world ’ s valuable research talent and limited resources is devoted to addressing the diseases of the poor .
this state of affairs represents a failure of economics and law that urgently needs to be corrected .
the good news is that there are now opportunities for change , most promisingly through an international effort headed by the World Health Organization that would begin to fix the broken intellectual-property regime that is holding back the development and availability of cheap drugs .
two main problems limit the availability of medicines today .
one is that they are very costly ; or , more accurately , the price charged for them is very high , though the cost of producing them is but a fraction of that amount .
second , drug development is geared toward maximizing profit , not social benefit , which skews efforts directed at the creation of medicines that are essential to human welfare .
because the poor have so little money to spend , drug companies , under current arrangements , have little incentive to do research on the diseases that afflict them .
it doesn ’ t have to be this way .
drug companies argue that high prices are necessary to fund research and development .
but , in the United States , it is actually the government that finances most health-related research and development – directly , through public support ( National Institutes of Health , National Science Foundation ) , and indirectly , through public purchases of medicine , both in the Medicare and Medicaid programs .
even the part that is not government-financed is not a conventional market ; most individuals ’ purchases of prescription medicines are covered by insurance .
government finances health-care research because improved medicines are a public good .
the resulting knowledge benefits everyone by stopping epidemics and limiting the economic and human toll of widespread illness .
efficiency requires sharing research as widely as possible as soon as it is available .
Thomas Jefferson compared knowledge to candles : when one is used to light another , it does not diminish the light of the first .
on the contrary , everything becomes brighter .
yet , in America and most of the world , drug prices are still exorbitant and the spread of knowledge is tightly limited .
that is because we have created a patent system that gives innovators a temporary monopoly over what they create , which encourages them to hoard their knowledge , lest they help a competitor .
while this system does provide incentives for certain kinds of research by making innovation profitable , it allows drug companies to drive up prices , and the incentives do not necessarily correspond to social returns .
in the health-care sector , it may be more profitable to devote research to a “ me-too ” drug than to the development of a treatment that really makes a difference .
the patent system may even have adverse effects on innovation , because , while the most important input into any research is prior ideas , the patent system encourages secrecy .
a solution to both high prices and misdirected research is to replace the current model with a government-supported prize fund .
with a prize system , innovators are rewarded for new knowledge , but they do not retain a monopoly on its use .
that way , the power of competitive markets can ensure that , once a drug is developed , it is made available at the lowest possible price – not at an inflated monopoly price .
fortunately , some US lawmakers are taking a strong interest in this approach .
the Prize Fund for HIV / AIDS Act , a congressional bill introduced by Senator Bernie Sanders , is just such an initiative .
his bill also contains an important provision aimed at encouraging open-source research , which would move the current research model away from secrecy toward sharing .
but , globally , our innovation system needs much bigger changes .
the WHO ’ s efforts to encourage broad reforms at the international level are crucial .
this spring , the WHO released a report that recommends solutions similar to those proposed in the US Senate bill , but on a global level .
in late May , the international community will have a chance to begin implementing these ideas at the WHO World Health Assembly – a moment of hope for public health around the world .
reforming our innovation system is not just a matter of economics .
it is , in many cases , a matter of life and death .
it is therefore essential to de-link R &amp; amp ; D incentives from drug prices , and to promote greater sharing of scientific knowledge .
for America , the Sanders bill marks important progress .
for the world , the WHO ’ s recommendations represent a once-in-a-generation opportunity to remedy a long-standing and egregious inequity in health care , and , more broadly , to set a model for governance of global public goods befitting an era of globalization .
we cannot afford to let this opportunity pass us by .
Cambridge – With youth unemployment touching 50 % in eurozone countries such as Spain and Greece , is a generation being sacrificed for the sake of a single currency that encompasses too diverse a group of countries to be sustainable ?
if so , does enlarging the euro ’ s membership really serve Europe ’ s apparent goal of maximizing economic integration without necessarily achieving full political union ?
the good news is that economic research does have a few things to say about whether Europe should have a single currency .
the bad news is that it has become increasingly clear that , at least for large countries , currency areas will be highly unstable unless they follow national borders .
at a minimum , currency unions require a confederation with far more centralized power over taxation and other policies than European leaders envision for the eurozone .
what of Nobel Prize winner Robert Mundell ’ s famous 1961 conjecture that national and currency borders need not significantly overlap ?
in his provocative American Economic Review paper “ A Theory of Optimum Currency Areas , ” Mundell argued that as long as workers could move within a currency region to where the jobs were , the region could afford to forgo the equilibrating mechanism of exchange-rate adjustment .
he credited another ( future ) Nobel Prize winner , James Meade , for having recognized the importance of labor mobility in earlier work , but criticized Meade for interpreting the idea too stringently , especially in the context of Europe ’ s nascent integration .
Mundell did not emphasize financial crises , but presumably labor mobility is more important today than ever .
not surprisingly , workers are leaving the eurozone ’ s crisis countries , but not necessarily for its stronger northern region .
instead , Portuguese workers are fleeing to booming former colonies such as Brazil and Macau .
Irish workers are leaving in droves to Canada , Australia , and the United States .
Spanish workers are streaming into Romania , which until recently had been a major source of agricultural labor in Spain .
still , if intra-eurozone mobility were anything like Mundell ’ s ideal , today we would not be seeing 25 % unemployment in Spain while Germany ’ s unemployment rate is below 7 % .
later writers came to recognize that there are other essential criteria for a successful currency union , which are difficult to achieve without deep political integration .
Peter Kenen argued in the late 1960 ’ s that without exchange-rate movements as a shock absorber , a currency union requires fiscal transfers as a way to share risk .
for a normal country , the national income-tax system constitutes a huge automatic stabilizer across regions .
in the US , when oil prices go up , incomes in Texas and Montana rise , which means that these states then contribute more tax revenue to the federal budget , thereby helping out the rest of the country .
Europe , of course , has no significant centralized tax authority , so this key automatic stabilizer is essentially absent .
some European academics tried to argue that there was no need for US-like fiscal transfers , because any desired degree of risk sharing can , in theory , be achieved through financial markets .
this claim was hugely misguided .
financial markets can be fragile , and they provide little capacity for sharing risk related to labor income , which constitutes the largest part of income in any advanced economy .
Kenen was mainly concerned with short-term transfers to smooth out cyclical bumpiness .
but , in a currency union with huge differences in income and development levels , the short term can stretch out for a very long time .
many Germans today rightly feel that any system of fiscal transfers will morph into a permanent feeding tube , much the way that northern Italy has been propping up southern Italy for the last century .
indeed , more than 20 years on , Western Germans still see no end in sight for the bills from German unification .
later , Maurice Obstfeld pointed out that , in addition to fiscal transfers , a currency union needs clearly defined rules for the lender of last resort .
otherwise , bank runs and debt panics will be rampant .
Obstfeld had in mind a bailout mechanism for banks , but it is now abundantly clear that one also needs a lender of last resort and a bankruptcy mechanism for states and municipalities .
a logical corollary of the criteria set forth by Kenen and Obstfeld , and even of Mundell ’ s labor-mobility criterion , is that currency unions cannot survive without political legitimacy , most likely involving region-wide popular elections .
Europe ’ s leaders cannot carry out large transfers across countries indefinitely without a coherent European political framework .
European policymakers today often complain that , were it not for the US financial crisis , the eurozone would be doing just fine .
perhaps they are right .
but any financial system must be able to withstand shocks , including big ones .
Europe may never be an “ optimum ” currency area by any standard .
but , without further profound political and economic integration – which may not end up including all current eurozone members – the euro may not make it even to the end of this decade .
Prague – On Christmas Day last year , one of China ’ s best-known human rights activists , the writer and university professor Liu Xiaobo , was condemned to 11 years in prison .
Liu is one of the main drafters of Charter 08 , a petition inspired by Czechoslovakia ’ s Charter 77 , calling on the Chinese government to adhere to its own laws and constitution , and demanding the open election of public officials , freedom of religion and expression , and the abolition of “ subversion ” laws .
for his bravery and clarity of thought about China ’ s future , Liu deserves the 2010 Nobel Peace Prize .
there are two reasons why we believe that Liu would be a worthy recipient of that prestigious award .
first and foremost , he stands in the tradition of Nobel Peace Prize laureates who have been recognized for their contribution to the struggle for human rights .
Nobel laureates such as Martin Luther King , Lech Walesa , and Aung San Suu Kyi are but a few of the many examples that the Nobel Committee has recognized in previous years .
we are convinced that the concepts that Liu and his colleagues put down on paper in December 2008 are both universal and timeless .
these ideals – respect for human rights and human dignity , and the responsibility of citizens to ensure that their governments respect those rights – represent humanity ’ s highest aspirations .
should the Nobel Committee choose to recognize Liu ’ s courage and sacrifice in articulating these ideals , it would not only draw global attention to the injustice of Liu ’ s 11-year sentence . it would also help to amplify within China the universal and humanistic values for which Liu has spent so much of his life fighting .
the second reason why Liu deserves the Nobel Peace Prize resonates with Alfred Nobel ’ s original intent for the award .
in working to promote human rights , political reform , and democratization in China , Liu has made a significant contribution to the values of peace and fraternity among nations that Nobel had in mind when he created the award more than a century ago .
of course , democratization does not automatically guarantee better behavior on the world stage . but it does facilitate a full and rigorous public debate over key questions of a state ’ s foreign and domestic policies .
this active and searching conversation , the hallmark of a democratic polity , is the best hope for better decisions by governments , both at home and abroad .
Liu ’ s committed advocacy on behalf of democracy in China is , above all , intended for the benefit of the Chinese people .
but his courage and example may help to accelerate the dawn of the day when China ’ s participation in international affairs is aided by the expertise and oversight of civil-society groups , an independent media , and an engaged citizenry able to express its views through the ballot box .
it is primarily for these two reasons that we believe that Liu would be a worthy recipient of the 2010 Nobel Peace Prize .
in conferring on Liu one of the world ’ s highest honors , the Committee would be signaling once again the importance of human rights and democracy on the one hand , and world peace and international solidarity on the other .
Liu ’ s harsh prison sentence was meant as an exemplary measure , a stern warning to all other Chinese who might want to follow his path .
we are convinced that there are moments when exemplary civic engagement , such as Liu ’ s , requires an exemplary response .
awarding him the Nobel Peace Prize is precisely the response that his courage deserves .
ITHACA – With 2012 underway , it is worth reflecting on how a decade of strong economic growth in emerging markets led to last year ’ s resounding political transformations .
from the dramatic events in the Middle East , to the groundswell of support for the anti-corruption crusader Anna Hazare in India , leaders in emerging markets are getting a clear message from the streets that growth is not everything .
they ignore this message at their peril .
emerging-market economies delivered solid growth during the 2000 ’ s , and even survived the global financial crisis without a growth collapse .
but the specter of rising corruption is compromising the legitimacy of their economic gains and eroding support for further reforms needed to sustain their growth momentum .
corruption takes many forms , but , in emerging markets , a combination of factors has turned it into a cancer that ultimately topples regimes .
relentless low-level corruption is a major irritant for poor people in many of these countries ; indeed , it limits their access to the social services and basic government functions that they often depend upon for their very survival .
another type of corruption involves siphoning enormous sums of money from large-scale projects .
in India , for example , the government lost as much as $ 30-40 billion of much-needed revenue when coveted band spectrum was sold through a rigged auction .
for ordinary people , large-scale corruption is less visible , because , while the sums involved are mind-boggling , the costs are not as directly felt as they are in the case of lower-level graft .
but the perception of this type of mega-corruption has changed as rapid growth has increased inequality .
in countries like China and India , rapid economic growth has lifted a huge number of people out of poverty .
but the fruits of globalization and rapid growth have not been evenly shared – the rich become super-rich , even as a large fraction of the population remains destitute .
rising income inequality is hardly limited to emerging markets , but their combination of open corruption and pervasive inequities creates a toxic brew that is undermining support for reforms that would strengthen and consolidate their economic gains .
in many emerging markets , a lack of political freedom adds to the combustible mix .
the combination of corruption , inequality , and political repression builds up enormous pressure , and there are no institutional channels through which to release it .
but freer political regimes are not a panacea .
in a democracy like India ’ s , the politically well-connected benefit from skewed growth , thus increasing the resentment of those left behind .
the opportunity to “ throw the rascals out ” in each election cycle helps to let off some steam , but it does not resolve the problems that are generating it .
it is difficult to predict what triggers popular protest , but economic factors are key .
for example , rising food prices tend to hurt the poor , especially the urban poor , who spend a large share of their income on food ; unlike agricultural workers , they receive none of the benefits of higher food prices .
with swelling urban populations , it will become increasingly difficult to keep a lid on these pressures .
some governments have reacted to recent events with political repression , information blackouts , or a combination of authoritarian measures .
China , for example , blocked media coverage of the Egyptian protests .
the Arab Spring , however , reveals the fragility of repressive political regimes that try to maintain their legitimacy by limiting information flows .
the main lesson for dynamic emerging-market countries is that an exclusive focus on GDP growth may ultimately not be good for economic and political stability .
even with rapid increases in national income , if these countries ’ leaders do not distribute the benefits fairly , they will become vulnerable to popular discontent .
tackling corruption is critical to improving long-term growth and maintaining social stability .
these economies need measures that help to keep the poor out of poverty traps , and that give them realistic opportunities to improve their economic well-being .
such steps include broadening financial markets to give more people access to credit and investment , strengthening social safety nets to protect the economically vulnerable , and improving educational access and quality .
these lessons apply equally to advanced economies , which also suffer from rising inequality and subtle forms of corruption .
but , for those wealthy economies , restoring decent growth is now the major priority .
emerging markets have a golden opportunity to build on their economic gains and lock in growth and stability by tackling deep-seated problems like corruption .
as the past year ’ s events have shown , the costs of inaction could be calamitous .
Oxford – In Anthony Burgess ’ s novella ( and Stanley Kubrick ’ s film ) A Clockwork Orange , Alex , an unrepentant psychopath , has his eyes pried wide open and is forced to watch violent images .
like Pavlov ’ s dog , Alex is being programmed to respond with nausea to violence and sex .
this scene remains shocking , but , like most science fiction , it has aged .
the behaviorist psychology it drew upon has long expired , and the fear that science will be used to make , or even force , people to be morally better now sounds old-fashioned .
science fiction ages fast , but it has a long afterlife .
over the past decade , an army of psychologists , neuroscientists , and evolutionary biologists has been busy trying to uncover the neural “ clockwork ” that underlies human morality .
they have started to trace the evolutionary origins of pro-social sentiments such as empathy , and have begun to uncover the genes that dispose some individuals to senseless violence and others to acts of altruism , and the pathways in our brain that shape our ethical decisions .
and to understand how something works is also to begin to see ways to modify and even control it .
indeed , scientists have not only identified some of the brain pathways that shape our ethical decisions , but also chemical substances that modulate this neural activity .
a recent study has shown that the anti-depressant Citalopram can change the responses of individuals to hypothetical moral dilemma scenarios .
individuals given the drug were less willing to sacrifice an individual to save the lives of several others .
another series of studies has shown that when the hormone oxytocin is administered via nasal spray , it increases trusting and cooperative behavior within social groups , but also decreases cooperation with those perceived as outsiders .
neuroscientists have even magnetically “ zapped ” carefully targeted areas of people ’ s brains to influence their moral judgments in surprising ways – for example , making it easier for them to lie .
of course , no one is developing a “ moral pill ” that will transform us into saints .
but the research is advancing fast , and it is almost certain to suggest new ways to reshape our moral intuitions , sentiments , and motivations .
should we use our growing scientific understanding of the basis of human morality to try to make people morally better ?
a Clockwork Orange was accused of glorifying violence , and some of its scenes are still hard to watch .
but as Burgess himself argued , the novella has an almost Christian message : what makes us human is our freedom to choose both good and evil , and for society to crush individuals into servile conformity is as wicked as , and perhaps even worse than , the sadism of psychopaths like Alex .
I suspect that many will agree with this view . they will agree that our ability to distinguish right from wrong is something precious that we should safeguard , not a broken clock that scientists should fix .
of course , most of us don ’ t need to be conditioned to feel repulsed by rape or torture .
but this does not mean that we are morally good , or good enough .
as you read this , perfectly ordinary people somewhere in the world are doing unspeakable things to others .
even in the most advanced and affluent societies , a vast concentrated effort is needed to preserve even minimal decency : think of locks , security alarms , police , courts , and prisons .
and it is doubtful that we really care enough about others , or give enough to the less fortunate .
humans are born with the capacity to be moral , but it is a limited capacity which is ill equipped to deal with the ethical complexities of the modern world .
for thousands of years , humans have relied on education , persuasion , social institutions , and the threat of real ( or supernatural ) punishment to make people behave decently .
we could all be morally better , but it is clear that this traditional approach cannot take us much further .
it is not as if people would suddenly begin to behave better if we just gave them more facts and statistics , or better arguments .
so we shouldn ’ t be too quick to dismiss the suggestion that science might help – in the first instance , by helping us design more effective institutions , more inspiring moral education , or more persuasive ethical arguments .
but science might also offer more direct ways of influencing our brains .
science fiction sometimes limits rather than expands our sense of what is possible .
it would be self-defeating , or worse , to try to promote morality through brutal coercion .
governments must not be given the power to control its citizens ’ moral code – we know that if they had such power , they would misuse it .
it would be ideal if individuals could freely explore different ways to improve themselves , whether by practicing mindfulness , reading moral philosophy , or , yes , by taking a ’ morality ’ pill .
but it is also true that although some people are eager to take pills that make them feel better or think faster , it is not so obvious that people would really want to take pills that would make them morally better . it is not clear that people really want to be morally better .
and those who , like the psychopathic Alex , need the most help are probably those who would want it least .
these are , of course , hypothetical questions .
we don ’ t yet know what is possible .
but it is better to begin the ethical discussion too early than too late .
and even if “ moral pills ” are just science fiction , they raise deep questions .
will we want to take them if they ever become available ?
and what does it say about us if we won ’ t ?
Princeton – When airports across Europe reopened after the closure caused by the eruption of Iceland ’ s Eyjafjallajökull volcano , it was not because the amount of ash in the atmosphere had dropped , but because the risk that the ash posed to airplane safety had been reassessed .
was it new scientific information that led to the lifting of the flight ban , or was it a reflection of the hardship , both personal and economic , that the ban was causing ?
over six days , about 95,000 flights were canceled , at a cost to airlines of more than $ 1 billion .
an estimated five million people were stranded or delayed .
the British economy lost £ 1.5 billion , and others were similarly affected .
flower growers in Kenya , who depend on air transport to take their short-lived product to Europe , suddenly had no income .
sixteen cancer patients in critical need of bone marrow for transplants were put at risk because the matching marrow could not be flown in from the United States or Canada .
in the past , jets flying into ash from volcanoes in the US , Indonesia , the Philippines , and Mexico have temporarily lost engine power , and in one case , dropped thousands of feet , although all managed to land safely .
but there was no evidence that the more widely dispersed ash blowing over Europe from Iceland would cause similar problems .
the decision to ground flights was based on the view that any level of ash in the atmosphere posed some risk to aircraft , and that no matter how slight that risk might be , the government ’ s job was , as British Prime Minister Gordon Brown put it , “ to make sure that safety was paramount . ”
indeed , in closing their skies , European governments seem to have given safety absolute priority over everything else .
yet none of them act on that principle in other areas .
some 3,000 people die on the world ’ s roads every day .
cutting speed limits to , say , 10 kilometers per hour would prevent most accidents and save many lives .
we don ’ t do it , because we give safety a lower priority than our desire to spend less time driving .
the price we are willing to pay for safety cannot be infinite .
it is distasteful to put a price on human life , but the more we spend on safety , the less we will have for our other goals .
the British government uses a figure of a little more than £ 1 million as a general limit to the amount it is prepared to pay to save a statistical life – for example , by improving road safety .
in the US , the Department of Transportation is prepared to go up to $ 5.8 million – nearly four times as much , at current exchange rates – for the same purpose .
does that mean that safety is paramount in the US , but not in Britain ?
Giovanni Bisignani , the head of the International Air Transport Association , an industry group , criticized the shutdown , saying that no risk assessment had been undertaken .
on the whole , though , the public seemed to support the decision .
stranded travelers , interviewed at airports , typically said that they would rather be stuck at an airport than in a plane falling out of the sky .
but what if some travelers have a higher tolerance of risk , or just a more urgent need to travel , than others ?
John Stuart Mill , in his classic book On Liberty , considered a situation in which a man sets out to cross a bridge that we know is unsafe .
in Mill ’ s view , we are justified in stopping him only to make sure that he is aware of the danger .
once he knows of it , the decision is his to make , because only he can judge the importance of his journey , and balance that against the risk he is running .
air safety is slightly different , because a crashing plane can kill people on the ground , but the greatest risks by far are borne by the passengers and crew .
if they are fully informed of the risks , and are still willing to fly – perhaps the crew has been offered more money , as workers in dangerous occupations often are – should we prevent them from making the decision to fly ?
in the end , after test flights with no passengers aboard had shown no engine damage , and aircraft engine manufacturers told aviation authorities that their engines could operate safely with a low level of ash in the atmosphere , Europe ’ s skies were reopened .
the International Civil Aviation Authority has announced that it will convene a group of experts to help it provide guidance for the industry to decide what level of ash in the atmosphere makes it unsafe to fly .
now that we have seen the costs of giving absolute priority to safety , we know that this is not only a technical question .
I trust that among the experts will be some who have pondered the underlying ethical question : how safe should we aim to be ?
the New York producer overseeing the project , a single mother , was reluctant initially to visit Ramallah – so the Palestinian team ’ s inability to produce their segments on time was , like so many aspects of the Palestinian experience , hidden behind a barrier of fear , not fully witnessed , and thus not fully comprehended .
the co-production has ended .
but there is a Palestinian Sesame Street and an Israeli Sesame Street , and there are positive Arab-Israeli characters in the Israeli version .
and the creators of these programs , together with the filmmakers behind “ When Muppets Dream of Peace , ” offer important lessons for all of us .
one quote from a Palestinian TV production team member stayed with me : “ This is a shotgun wedding , ” he explained when he was advocating for a Palestine-only Sesame Street . “ And we want a divorce . ”
the Palestinian team is utterly indistinguishable , superficially , from their European or Israeli counterparts : they are hip , young , talented , sophisticated , and more than anything they want to work to create a positive environment for their kids – or at least a psychological respite from the reality of occupation , violence , and war .
but how often does the outside world – even the best-intentioned donors and program creators – reach out to Palestinian civil society on its own terms , without insisting on that “ shotgun wedding ? ”
how often are resources invested in Palestinian films , books , newspapers , high schools , dance troupes , teachers , etc. without requiring the recipients to make friendly gestures to Israel ?
many civil-society elements in the Muslim world have turned their backs on possible partnerships with Israeli counterparts .
one Egyptian actor was boycotted at home for merely appearing in Cannes with an Israeli actress .
but I am certain that the more intently outsiders invest in Palestinian civil society on its own terms , the less exasperated the Palestinian intelligentsia – and the Muslim world – will become with the often-coerced terms of Palestine &apos;s creativity .
a vibrant Palestinian civil society could become more flexible and open toward possible partnerships – including more natural , holistic Israeli-Palestinian joint ventures – thus benefiting the region as a whole .
the Muppets have taught generations of kids worldwide how to count to ten and share cookies .
in the 1970 ’ s in the United States , they taught us about an interracial couple on Sesame Street .
in South Africa , the creators asked for – and got – a puppet that was an HIV-positive child , since acceptance of such kids was a lesson that local educators told the New York team they needed to teach .
in the Sesame Street of Palestine and Israel , the failure of the joint venture was really a success : the Muppets and their creators have given us another valuable lesson , this time in how – and how not – to help others .
new YORK – What possessed the young French Muslim Mohammed Merah to murder three Jewish schoolchildren , a rabbi , and three soldiers , two of them fellow Muslims ?
what possessed another man , Anders Breivik , to gun down more than 60 teenagers in a Norwegian summer camp last year ?
these murder sprees are so unusual that people demand explanations .
to call these killers “ monsters , ” as some were quick to do , sheds little light on the problem .
they were not monsters ; they were young men .
and to dismiss them as madmen is equally evasive .
if they were clinically insane , nothing more would need to be explained .
two accounts , both broadly socio-political , stand out .
one was put forward by the controversial Muslim activist Tariq Ramadan . he blames French society .
more specifically , he blames the fact that young Frenchmen of Muslim origin are marginalized on the grounds of their faith and the color of their skin .
even though these people have French passports , they are treated as unwanted foreigners .
when French President Nicolas Sarkozy , himself the son of immigrants , says that there are too many foreigners in France , he drives young men like Merah farther into a corner .
a tiny minority of such men might lash out in desperation .
the other explanation , favored by Sarkozy , takes Merah at his word . he said that he was protesting French military operations in Muslim countries and avenging the killing of Palestinian children .
he wanted to bring down the French state as an Islamic holy warrior .
he was inspired by al-Qaeda .
so why not believe him ?
hence Sarkozy ’ s decision to arrest other Muslim men suspected of Islamic extremism and bar certain imams from attending a religious conference in France .
those who view Islamic extremism as the problem also tend to hold up young killers like Merah as examples of failed integration .
they never became sufficiently French .
immigrants must be forced to share “ Western values . ”
although no one would argue that Anders Breivik is insufficiently Norwegian , he , too , could be taken at his word .
the rhetoric of xenophobic demagogues appears to have convinced him that he had to kill the children of the social-democratic elites in order to protect Western civilization against the dangers of multiculturalism and Islam .
his murders were the extreme result of dangerous ideas .
neither explanation is entirely wrong .
many young Muslims feel unwanted in their countries of birth , and extreme language , whether used by Islamists or their opponents , helps to create an atmosphere conducive to violence .
but both Ramadan and Sarkozy are too simplistic , for they reduce extraordinary murders to single explanations .
even when they are faced with rejection , most young Muslim men do not become mass murderers .
Merah is too anomalous to serve as a typical example of anything , including racial or religious discrimination .
far from being a religious fanatic , Merah grew up as a petty criminal with no interest in religion .
the appeal of Islamist extremism may have been its glorification of violence more than any religious content .
he enjoyed watching jihadist videos of beheadings .
he also tried to join the French army and the Foreign Legion .
the army turned him down because of his criminal record .
if the French wouldn ’ t have him , he would join the holy warriors : anything to give him a sense of power and an excuse to indulge his violent impulses .
many young men are drawn to the fantasy of violence ; far fewer feel the need to act it out .
ideology can serve as an excuse or justification , but it is rarely the main source of individual acts of brutality .
murder sprees are more often than not a form of personal revenge – losers wishing to blow up the world around them , because they feel humiliated or rejected , whether socially , professionally , or sexually .
sometimes , the killers appear to lack any excuse at all , as in the case of Eric Harris and Dylan Klebold , who in 1999 shot 12 fellow-students and a teacher at their high school in Columbine , Colorado .
in that case , people blamed the sadistic video games and movies that the killers had been watching .
still , most enthusiasts of this type of entertainment do not actually go out and kill people .
Breivik had fantasies of being a knight fighting the enemies of the West .
Merah imagined that he was a jihadi .
who knows what the Columbine killers thought they were doing .
but the reasons why they killed lie within them , and cannot be principally attributed to the entertainment or other materials that they consumed .
banning such materials has an aesthetic appeal , to be sure , and public figures who preach violence should always be condemned .
hate speech and violent ideology are not irrelevant .
but to make too much of them in cases such as those of Merah or Breivik can be misleading .
censorship is unlikely to solve the problem .
banning Hitler ’ s Mein Kampf or forbidding the display of Nazi symbols has not stopped neo-Nazis in Germany from murdering immigrants .
suppressing violent pornography will not get rid of rapists or high-school killers .
preventing demagogues from ranting about Muslims or multi-culturalists will not deter a future Anders Breivik .
and barring radical imams from entering France won ’ t stop another Merah from going on a murderous rampage .
in fact , to compare Merah ’ s savage deeds to the killings of September 11 , 2001 , as Sarkozy has done , is to give the killer too much credit .
there is no evidence that he is part of any organized group , or in the vanguard of a revolutionary movement .
using his case to stoke fear of an Islamic threat to society might make electoral sense for Sarkozy .
but provoking fear is seldom the best recipe for avoiding further violence . on the contrary , it is more likely to fuel it .
desperate to hold onto power , Pervez Musharraf has discarded Pakistan ’ s constitutional framework and declared a state of emergency .
his goal ?
to stifle the independent judiciary and free media .
artfully , though shamelessly , he has tried to sell this action as an effort to bring about stability and help fight the war on terror more effectively .
nothing could be further from the truth .
if Pakistan ’ s history is any indicator , his decision to impose martial law may prove to be the proverbial straw that breaks the camel ’ s back .
general Musharraf appeared on the national scene on October 12 , 1999 , when he ousted an elected government and announced an ambitious “ nation-building ” project .
many Pakistanis , disillusioned with Pakistan ’ s political class , remained mute , thinking that he might deliver .
the September 11 , 2001 , terrorist attacks on America brought Musharraf into the international limelight as he agreed to ditch the Taliban and support the United States-led war on terror .
Musharraf clamped down on some religious militants operating inside Pakistan and also on those fighting Indian forces in Kashmir .
as a result , Pakistan was rewarded with American financial assistance and arms .
in furtherance of his re-alignment , Musharraf sent the Pakistani army into the tribal areas bordering Afghanistan for the first time since Pakistan ’ s independence .
operations there against Taliban and al-Qaeda forces brought mixed results .
although the US viewed Musharraf as an agent of change , he has never achieved domestic political legitimacy , and his policies were seen as rife with contradictions .
for example , he made alliances with Islamist political forces ( who in 2004 voted for constitutional changes legitimizing his position and actions ) . at the same time , he sidelined moderate , mainstream political leaders while claiming that he stood for “ enlightened moderation . ”
a series of ill-planned military operations in the tribal areas further complicated the situation in the volatile border region .
last March , Musharraf took his boldest step , removing the Chief Justice of the Supreme Court , Iftikhar Chaudhry .
to the surprise of many , the country ’ s legal community organized a nation-wide movement to restore the Chief Justice to his post .
hundreds of thousands of ordinary people demanded the rule of law and the supremacy of the constitution , emboldening the judiciary and changing the country ’ s political dynamic .
in a historic ruling that Musharraf had little choice but to accept , the Supreme Court itself reinstated the Chief Justice in July .
subsequently , the energized judiciary continued ruling against government decisions , embarrassing the government – especially its intelligence agencies .
government officials were held accountable for actions that were usually beyond the reach of the law , ranging from brutal beatings of journalists , to illegal confinement for “ national security . ”
Musharraf and his political allies tried to adjust to this new reality , but their patience ran out when the Supreme Court took up petitions against Musharraf ’ s decision to run for president .
according to the constitution ( originally promulgated in 1973 by an elected parliament ) , a serving military official cannot run for an elected office .
Musharraf was not ready to give up his military post , but also wanted to be a civilian president .
while he announced that he would leave his military position “ if ” he was elected president , his track record of reneging on his promises haunted the judiciary .
the proceedings of the court over the last few weeks made Musharraf jittery . the decision of the 11-member bench might easily have gone against him .
legally cornered , Musharraf has now decided to abandon constitutionality , removing the leading judges of the Supreme Court and provincial high courts and putting curbs on the media .
lawyers , human rights activists , and political leaders have since been arrested .
there is widespread public resentment in response to these moves .
rather than taking responsibility for the deteriorating security situation ( as evidenced by regular suicide bomb attacks ) and the increasing Talibanization of the tribal areas , Musharraf has tried to blame the judiciary and media .
to be sure , in some cases , judicial activism was obvious ( though within the realm of constitutional law ) , and the media also made mistakes ; but by no stretch of the imagination can these be linked to religious extremism or support for militancy .
it is unlikely that Musharraf ’ s latest gambit will succeed , as his popular support is at its lowest ebb .
Pakistan ’ s armed forces – repeated targets of suicide bombers – have become demoralized .
it is difficult to imagine them standing with Musharraf should civil conflict erupt .
nor can a weak , embattled , and disoriented Musharraf be expected to fight Islamic militancy effectively or bring political stability to Pakistan .
opposition political parties are drawing closer together , and former Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto , despite progress in her power-sharing negotiations with Musharraf , has strongly condemned his actions .
human rights bodies , media associations , and lawyers ’ organizations are expected to defy the emergency , which will pit them against the security forces .
terrorists may also benefit by attacking a preoccupied army and political forces aligned with Musharraf .
in the event of sustained protests and potential violence , top military commanders may decide to send Musharraf home – a decision that would not be unprecedented in Pakistan ’ s chronically turbulent history .
Lahore – Pakistan ’ s former president , Pervez Musharraf , has decided to return to Pakistani politics , if not quite to Pakistan .
he announced his decision at London ’ s National Liberal Club , an institution founded in the nineteenth century by William Gladstone and other stalwarts of Britain ’ s parliamentary tradition .
the choice of venue was , of course , steeped in irony .
Musharraf did not uphold the Gladstonian tradition while he was in office for almost nine years , from October 1999 to August 2008 .
indeed , he admitted as much in his speech at the launch of his political party , the All Pakistan Muslim League , from a safe distance of thousands of miles from an increasingly turbulent Pakistan .
although Musharraf did not elaborate on his “ mistakes , ” the reference was obvious : his impulsive decision in March 2007 to fire Chief Justice Iftikhar Chaudhry from the Supreme Court .
the judge had refused to be directed by the president and the military in deciding important constitutional matters , including Musharraf ’ s own eligibility to contest the presidency while still in uniform .
the second “ mistake ” came the following November , after Musharraf ’ s government failed to contain the legal community ’ s impressive civil-disobedience movement to pressure the government into reinstating Chaudhry .
Musharraf , again acting impulsively , placed the country under emergency rule when Chaudhry was brought back by a decision of his own court .
Chaudhry was fired again , a move accompanied this time by a wider shakeup of the already shaken-up judiciary .
the government emptied the Supreme Court of relatively independent judges and installed a more “ trustworthy ” group .
the strategy didn ’ t work , and the lawyers returned to agitating .
Musharraf withdrew the emergency and restored the constitution , but a few days later Benazir Bhutto was assassinated in Rawalpindi after she addressed a large election rally .
Musharraf postponed the elections scheduled for December 2007 until February 2008 .
many assumed that Musharraf would follow the lead of his military predecessors , who on several occasions announced elections and a return to democracy , only to postpone the vote when it drew near .
but Musharraf surprised the Pakistani political establishment and held the election , in which the Pakistan Muslim League ( the Quaid Group ) , his political base , was trounced by Bhutto ’ s Pakistan People ’ s Party and the Pakistan Muslim Group ( the Nawaz Group ) .
the second Muslim League was headed by Nawaz Sharif , twice Pakistan ’ s prime minister .
his second tenure ended when Musharraf removed him from office in October 1999 to establish the country ’ s fourth military regime .
following the coup , Bhutto and Nawaz fled into exile , and were allowed back into the country only after Musharraf , hoping that their return would help deflect public attention from the lawyers ’ protest movement , announced that he would hold elections .
given the way Musharraf governed the country , it is hard to imagine that he will be able to stage a political comeback .
Pakistan these days is a troubled country , politically as well as economically .
but talk of regime change may have prompted Musharraf to re-enter politics .
only a politician who has the support of major constituencies can hope to restore political order and economic health , and Musharraf is presenting himself as a candidate whom the military might support .
thus , in a long interview with the BBC before launching his new party , Musharraf suggested that Pakistan ’ s army was the only institution that could save the country from its current woes . “ There is a sense of despondency in Pakistan , and the place that the people go to is the military , ” he said .
“ There ’ s nobody else to whom they can go . in Pakistan , they come to the army headquarters , they come to the army chief , they run there , and they ask them to act .
they don ’ t trust the politicians . ”
while there may be some element of truth in this , Musharraf appears not to have learned the lesson of his final year in office .
then , an energized legal community , supported by a hyperactive media , was able to defy a military government .
it is unlikely that most Pakistanis , despite their distrust of Pakistan ’ s politicians , will be inclined to turn to someone with Musharraf ’ s history .
the army , in fact , recognizes this .
it also realizes that Pakistan can be effectively governed only if its leaders have the support of other important constituencies . these include the large and growing middle class , which has a strong presence in Punjab ’ s many large cities – where Nawaz ’ s Muslim League governs .
the muhajir community – the refugees who migrated from India in 1947 – has its own political party , the Muhajir Qaumi Movement , which governs Sindh and its large cities with the help of the People ’ s Party .
the PPP remains popular in rural Sindh and among the country ’ s poor and lower middle class .
the Pashtuns have their own party , the National Awami Party , which governs the newly named province of Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa , on the border with Afghanistan .
despite today ’ s turbulence , it is unlikely that the military will intervene directly and taken over the reins of government , as it has on four occasions in Pakistan ’ s history .
if , however , it is to orchestrate a regime change – which it might attempt to do – it will not likely disregard these groups and their powerbases by imposing their former commander on the political system .
the military , if it is to play a role , will try to find new leaders from among the political establishment .
the political stage is too crowded for Musharraf to find a place to stand .
London &amp; # 45 ; &amp; # 45 ; In the 1960 ’ s , feminists coined the slogan , “ Our bodies , our selves . ” But that liberating sentiment has recently undergone an ironic twist .
as an anonymous American woman , justifying her decision to undergo cosmetic surgery , put it , “ All we have in life is ourselves , and what we can put out there every day for the world to see … Me is all I got . ”
the French commentator Hervé Juvin extolled this new attitude towards the body in his 2005 surprise bestseller , L ’ avènement du corps ( The Coming of the Body ) .
plastic surgery , the implantation of biochips , piercings – all emblazon the belief that our bodies are our unique property .
at the same time , Juvin asserts , because everyone has a body , property has suddenly become democratized .
we appear to live in a time that has witnessed the absolute failure of the grand Enlightenment dreams of linear progress , universal peace , and equality between rich and poor .
together with widespread hostility to organized religion , manifested in such hugely popular books as Richard Dawkins ’ s The God Delusion , disappointment with social ideals means that we turn inward .
in the absence of a belief in eternal life , everything becomes invested in this life , this body .
long life is our desire , eternal youth our supposed right , and the myth of the body without origin or limits our new religion .
that might be why governments are so widely seen to have a positive duty to promote stem cell research and other forms of medical progress .
biotechnology industries flourish , with state sanction and support , because they add extra value to the body , the object of supreme worth to us .
indeed , the infinite renewal of the body isn ’ t confined to superficial repairs through cosmetic surgery .
external substitutes for organic structures can be surgically implanted , breaking down the barrier between the body and the outside world .
at the same time , tissue removed from the body enters into commerce and trade as a commodity like any other , in the form of stem cell lines , human eggs , and other “ products . ”
the American law professor James Boyle believes that we can grasp the way in which the body has become an object of trade by likening it to the historical process of enclosure .
in eighteenth-century Britain , land , which was previously a public resource , was “ enclosed ” by private owners .
freed of feudal-style legal restrictions on transfer of ownership and of traditional rights held by commoners who used communal land to pasture their animals , landholdings could now be sold to raise capital , which helped to finance the industrial revolution .
in modern biotechnology , Boyle thinks , things previously outside the market-once thought to be impossible to commodify-are becoming routinely privatized .
one in five human genes is now patented , even though the human genome might be thought to be our common heritage .
and although Boyle doesn ’ t mention this latest development , umbilical cord blood , taken in the final stage of labor , is now banked by profit-making firms as a potential – though unlikely – source of stem cells for the baby .
in biomedicine , a series of legal cases have generated powerful momentum toward the transfer of rights over the body and its component parts from the individual “ owner ” to corporations and research institutions .
so the body has entered the market , becoming capital , just as land did , though not everyone benefits , any more than the dispossessed commoners grew wealthy during the agricultural enclosures .
most people are shocked when they learn that one-fifth of the human genome has been patented , mostly by private firms .
but why be so surprised ?
after all , female bodies have been subject to various forms of property-holding over many centuries and in many societies .
women ’ s bodies are used to sell everything from cars to pop music , of course .
but female tissue has been objectified and commodified in much more profound ways , in legal systems from Athens onwards .
while men were also made into objects of ownership and trade , as slaves , in general women were much more likely to be treated as commodities in non-slave-owning systems .
once a woman had given her initial consent to the marriage “ contract , ” she had no right to retract her consent to sexual relations – ever .
there are clear parallels between that situation and the way in which the common law has offered little redress to patients who have tried to claim property rights in tissue taken from them , or to activists seeking to limit the powers of Big Biotech over human genetic patents .
all bodies are assumed to be “ open access ” now , just as women ’ s have always been .
but the assault on freedom is perceived as such only when it begins to apply to men .
it took a long time for people to notice that women ’ s eggs were required in large quantities for stem cell technologies : a phenomenon I call “ the lady vanishes . ”
the stem cell debates often seem to be premised on the assumption that only the status of the embryo matters .
many people are still unaware that women ’ s eggs are a crucial part of “ therapeutic cloning . ” By contrast , genetic patenting , which affects both sexes , has ( rightly ) generated a huge scholarly literature and a very vigorous popular debate .
just a coincidence ?
the new enclosures of the genetic commons or of body tissue threaten to extend the objectification and commodification of the body to both sexes .
everyone has a female body now , or , more properly , a feminized body .
rather than holding an investment in our bodies , we ’ re all at risk of becoming capital : my body , but somebody else ’ s capital .
for millions of young people around the world , their introduction to Ernesto Che Guevara will be Gael Garia Bernal as Che and Rodrigo De la Serna as his friend Alberto , kicking back the stand of an overloaded motorcycle , hopping aboard , and lumbering north on an 8,000-mile journey through South America in the film version of Che &apos;s Motorcycle Diaries .
for those of us in Cuba old enough to take a similar trip , our journey with Che , the young man with the funny accent and starred beret , began with less romance .
&quot; Pioneros por el comunismo , seremos como el Che !
( pioneers for Communism , like Che we shall be ! ) , &quot; we repeated day after day before starting class .
the chant became so tedious that inevitably , the class clown would ask if the incantation would end up turning us all into asthmatics , as Che was .
Che &apos;s life and deeds all became part of a modern bible for young Cubans .
even if we wanted to reject what was force-fed in chants or poems like &quot; Che Comandante , &quot; it was hard to resist the charm and passion that came from his letters and diaries .
in his speeches , I discovered the brilliant Che , mercilessly railing against inefficiency , false politics , and double standards .
&quot; if we lack organization , the ideas , after the impetus of the first moment , lose their effectiveness , fall into the basic routines and conformity , and become simply a memory , &quot; he once said .
I looked around our island and wondered : was anyone listening ?
I discovered the Che who scribbled love poems and coveted his solitude .
I wanted to sit with him for a beer and a cigarette to talk about his love for chess or his favorite books .
with the crisis of the 1990 &apos;s brought on by the collapse of our Soviet patron , many Cubans returned to what Che said about economics , and admit the value of what is achieved with effort .
we felt once again the integrity of what it &apos;s like to share the burden of a common predicament .
the value of our homemade solutions increased to some who had always favored ideas imported from the East .
then Che &apos;s face flooded our lives , staring at us from T-shirts , banners , walls , and key rings , with a look as vigilant as those on the faces in the murals of the Committees for the Defense of the Revolution .
the solemn face that Alberto Korda caught in his photographs became tough and unsympathetic .
he stopped being San Ernesto de la Izquierda , the saint or talisman who delivered us from injustice . instead , he rose like the flag of the trivial in a global mass culture - a sign associated with consumer tastes in fashion , music , and drugs .
to rediscover the Che who could inspire , I returned to the young Ernesto of Che &apos;s diary .
I thought again about how on his trip through Latin America , he acquired his revolutionary ideals , clarified certain questions , and added more . I loved how he was brave enough to postpone his life for a while to find his own answers .
today , a photo of Che &apos;s image displayed on the façade of Cuba &apos;s Interior Ministry is a must-have for tourists .
visitors leave and continue their imaginary leftist lives with full refrigerators . we Cubans remain , in charge of keeping the flame alive .
I wonder , Ernesto , what you would have turned into had you lived ?
an archetype feeding the legend ?
a general talking down to us with reprimands ?
a favorite leader ?
a twenty-first century Quixote tilting at the windmills of canned politics ?
a postcard ?
a repressor of feelings ?
or just another dinosaur ?
new YORK – The destruction of Hiroshima and Nagasaki in 1945 marked an end and a beginning . the close of the Second World War ushered in a Cold War , with a precarious peace based on the threat of mutually assured destruction .
today the world is at another turning point . the assumption that nuclear weapons are indispensable to keeping the peace is crumbling . disarmament is back on the global agenda – and not a moment too soon .
a groundswell of new international initiatives will soon emerge to move this agenda forward .
the Cold War ’ s end , twenty years ago this autumn , was supposed to provide a peace dividend . instead , we find ourselves still facing serious nuclear threats . some stem from the persistence of more than 20,000 nuclear weapons and the contagious doctrine of nuclear deterrence . others relate to nuclear tests — more than a dozen in the post-Cold War era , aggravated by the constant testing of long-range missiles .
still others arise from concerns that more countries or even terrorists might be seeking the bomb .
many efforts are underway worldwide to achieve this goal . earlier this year , the 65-member Conference on Disarmament — the forum that produces multilateral disarmament treaties — broke a deadlock and agreed to negotiations on a fissile material treaty . other issues it will discuss include nuclear disarmament and security assurances for non-nuclear-weapon states .
in addition , Australia and Japan have launched a major international commission on nuclear non-proliferation and disarmament . my own multimedia “ WMD — WeMustDisarm ! ” campaign , which will culminate on the International Day of Peace ( 21 September ) , will reinforce growing calls for disarmament by former statesmen and grassroots campaigns , such as “ Global Zero . ”
these calls will get a further boost in September when civil society groups gather in Mexico City for a UN-sponsored conference on disarmament and development .
though the UN has been working on disarmament since 1946 , two treaties negotiated under UN auspices are now commanding the world ’ s attention .
also in September , countries that have signed the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test Ban Treaty ( CTBT ) will meet at the UN to consider ways to promote its early entry into force . North Korea ’ s nuclear tests , its missile launches and its threats of further provocation lend new urgency to this cause .
my own five-point plan to achieve this goal begins with a call for the NPT Parties to pursue negotiations in good faith — as required by the treaty — on nuclear disarmament , either through a new convention or through a series of mutually reinforcing instruments backed by a credible system of verification . disarmament must be reliably verified .
my third proposal relates to the rule of law . universal membership in multilateral treaties is key , as are regional nuclear-weapon-free zones and a new treaty on fissile materials . President Barack Obama ’ s support for US ratification of the CTBT is welcome — the treaty only needs a few more ratifications to enter into force . disarmament must be rooted in legal obligations .
my fourth point addresses accountability and transparency . countries with nuclear weapons should publish more information about what they are doing to fulfill their disarmament commitments . while most of these countries have revealed some details about their weapons programs , we still do not know how many nuclear weapons exist worldwide . the UN Secretariat could serve as a repository for such data.Disarmament must be visible to the public .
finally , I am urging progress in eliminating other weapons of mass destruction and limiting missiles , space weapons and conventional arms — all of which are needed for a nuclear-weapon-free world.Disarmament must anticipate emerging dangers from other weapons .
this , then , is my plan to drop the bomb . global security challenges are serious enough without the risks from nuclear weapons or their acquisition by additional states or non-state actors . of course , strategic stability , trust among nations , and the settlement of regional conflicts would all help to advance the process of disarmament . yet disarmament has its own contributions to make in serving these goals and should not be postponed .
it will restore hope for a more peaceful , secure and prosperous future . it deserves everybody ’ s support .
new HAVEN – At this time of year , at graduation ceremonies in America and elsewhere , those about to leave university often hear some final words of advice before receiving their diplomas .
to those interested in pursuing careers in finance – or related careers in insurance , accounting , auditing , law , or corporate management – I submit the following address :
best of luck to you as you leave the academy for your chosen professions in finance .
over the course of your careers , Wall Street and its kindred institutions will need you .
your training in financial theory , economics , mathematics , and statistics will serve you well .
but your lessons in history , philosophy , and literature will be just as important , because it is vital not only that you have the right tools , but also that you never lose sight of the purposes and overriding social goals of finance .
unless you have been studying at the bottom of the ocean , you know that the financial sector has come under severe criticism – much of it justified – for thrusting the world economy into its worst crisis since the Great Depression .
and you need only check in with some of your classmates who have populated the Occupy movements around the world to sense the widespread resentment of financiers and the top 1 % of income earners to whom they largely cater ( and often belong ) .
while some of this criticism may be over-stated or misplaced , it nonetheless underscores the need to reform financial institutions and practices .
finance has long been central to thriving market democracies , which is why its current problems need to be addressed .
with your improved sense of our interconnectedness and diverse needs , you can do that .
indeed , it is the real professional challenge ahead of you , and you should embrace it as an opportunity .
young finance professionals need to familiarize themselves with the history of banking , and recognize that it is at its best when it serves ever-broadening spheres of society .
here , the savings-bank movement in the United Kingdom and Europe in the nineteenth century , and the microfinance movement pioneered by the Grameen Bank in Bangladesh in the twentieth century , comes to mind .
today , the best way forward is to update financial and communications technology to offer a full array of enlightened banking services to the lower middle class and the poor .
graduates going into mortgage banking are faced with a different , but equally vital , challenge : to design new , more flexible loans that will better help homeowners to weather the kind of economic turbulence that has buried millions of people today in debt .
beyond investment banks and brokerage houses , modern finance has a public and governmental dimension , which clearly needs reinventing in the wake of the recent financial crisis .
setting the rules of the game for a robust , socially useful financial sector has never been more important .
recent graduates are needed in legislative and administrative agencies to analyze the legal infrastructure of finance , and regulate it so that it produces the greatest results for society .
a new generation of political leaders needs to understand the importance of financial literacy and find ways to supply citizens with the legal and financial advice that they need .
meanwhile , economic policymakers face the great challenge of designing new financial institutions , such as pension systems and public entitlements based on the solid grounding of intergenerational risk-sharing .
those of you deciding to pursue careers as economists and finance scholars need to develop a better understanding of asset bubbles – and better ways to communicate this understanding to the finance profession and to the public .
as much as Wall Street had a hand in the current crisis , it began as a broadly held belief that housing prices could not fall – a belief that fueled a full-blown social contagion .
learning how to spot such bubbles and deal with them before they infect entire economies will be a major challenge for the next generation of finance scholars .
equipped with sophisticated financial ideas ranging from the capital asset pricing model to intricate options-pricing formulas , you are certainly and justifiably interested in building materially rewarding careers .
there is no shame in this , and your financial success will reflect to a large degree your effectiveness in producing strong results for the firms that employ you .
but , however imperceptibly , the rewards for success on Wall Street , and in finance more generally , are changing , just as the definition of finance must change if is to reclaim its stature in society and the trust of citizens and leaders .
finance , at its best , does not merely manage risk , but also acts as the steward of society ’ s assets and an advocate of its deepest goals .
beyond compensation , the next generation of finance professionals will be paid its truest rewards in the satisfaction that comes with the gains made in democratizing finance – extending its benefits into corners of society where they are most needed .
this is a new challenge for a new generation , and will require all of the imagination and skill that you can bring to bear .
good luck in reinventing finance .
the world needs you to succeed .
Boston – September 11 , 2001 , may – at least at first – seem like an inappropriate addition to the history of nationalism , given Al Qaeda ’ s explicitly stated global pretensions .
in fact , now that the initial shock and confusion have given way to a more sober perspective , the terrorist attacks of that awful day are increasingly seen – as they should be – as one among numerous other nationalist milestones .
from this perspective , the attacks no longer appear , as they did to so many immediately afterwards , to reflect an incomprehensible , irrational , and uncivilized mentality , or a different civilization altogether – pre-modern , unenlightened , and fundamentally “ traditional ” ( in other words , undeveloped ) .
it is in this unflattering sense that Islam , the dominant religion of an economically backward part of the world , was said to have motivated the attacks of September 11 , 2001 .
and , because those who believed this ( virtually everyone whose voices were heard ) belatedly perceived its insulting connotation , discussing the matter has caused considerable anguish in the years since .
there are no euphemisms that can inoffensively imply that one of the great world religions is a murderous , irrational ideology , unacceptable for modern , civilized human beings .
and yet two different American administrations have implied – and consistently acted upon – this assumption .
but , once we place the tragedy of September 11 , 2001 , and the broader political phenomenon of international terrorism , in the context of other historical tragedies in the past century , religion becomes an unlikely explanation .
it is here where the influence of nationalism becomes obvious .
nationalism has been the major motive force in the West since the beginning of the modern period .
historians have noted its influence in Elizabethan England ( which produced the spirit animating the Puritan Rebellion and migration to America ) , and increasingly recognize it as the motive force behind the French and the Russian Revolutions .
meanwhile , Chinese scholars are beginning to view it as the inspiration for Mao Zedong ’ s struggle against the Kuomintang ( the openly self-named “ Nationalist Movement ” ) and the policies of the People ’ s Republic .
and no historical acumen is needed to understand that nationalism was the source of Hitler ’ s National Socialism and , therefore , World War II .
in fact , it would be puzzling if this were not the case , given that nationalism is the cultural foundation of modernity – the framework of its social consciousness .
and , precisely because nationalism shapes the way we think , its role in phenomena that do not trumpet their nationalist motivation – like Al Qaeda ’ s attacks in 2001 – can easily be overlooked .
as a rule , most nationalists do not call themselves nationalists .
like the rest of us , they believe that their nationalism is natural and does not have to be emphasized .
but a little self-examination should lead any thinking person to recognize that we all are nationalists – we feel , think , and react to the world as nationalism prescribes .
nationalism is a temporal vision ( and thus secular , even when using religion in its rhetoric ) that divides people into sovereign communities of equal members .
the equality of national membership ( which , at the same time , may be exclusively defined ) elevates every member ’ s status to that of the elite , making it dependent on the dignity of the nation as a whole .
as a result , those who possess national consciousness become committed to and defensive of the dignity of the nation – measured by its standing , or prestige , vis-à-vis other nations .
that is why competition for national prestige has been the main motive in international politics since the beginning of the twentieth century .
specifically , the aggressor in many international conflicts in this period has been motivated by perceived injury to national dignity .
actual injury is not necessary : the perceived superiority of another nation is enough .
in an advanced modern society , such as Germany , intellectuals have no difficulty using openly nationalist language to convince a nationally conscious populace of threats to national prestige .
by contrast , in a society where national consciousness is limited to the better educated ( for example , the Arab Middle East ) , they must resort to traditional means of mobilization .
in the case of the Middle East , that traditional mobilizer is Islam , and so threats to national prestige are presented as threats to Islam .
some nations do not feel threatened by imaginary insults to national dignity – for various historical reasons , they believe themselves to be superior to others .
but , if their prestige is in fact at stake , the perception of a threat becomes decisive .
why else would citizens across the developed world be so preoccupied with their economic competitiveness ?
is it not enough for us to be well off ?
why do we need to be better off than others ?
why , for example , do Americans feel so threatened by the peaceful economic rise of China ( as they did by Japan ’ s economic success in the 1980 ’ s ) ?
to no longer be “ Number One ” would offend America ’ s sense of dignity .
there is no more to it than that .
China is now also motivated by nationalism , and it will rise as high as a motivated population of 1.3 billion people can .
the threat to America ’ s international standing is real ; but , blinded by it , Americans believe that they are still in a position to condescend to China as they would to an inferior power .
for the time being , the Chinese may be too preoccupied with their own backyard to pay attention to such insults , but it is foolish to offend them deliberately .
because Americans misunderstood the motives behind the attacks of September 11 , 2001 , the United States fought two costly wars , which did not defeat its enemies and have left the Middle East more volatile than ever .
being blind to the connection between nationalism and dignity in China – and in America ’ s own conduct when dealing with China – may cost the US even more .
last week , the heads of state and government of NATO &apos;s 26 member nations gathered in Istanbul for a major summit .
the symbolism of a city that bridges two continents was especially appropriate .
in Istanbul , we not only reinforced the alliance &apos;s vital transatlantic link , but also built bridges of cooperation to other regions .
after the discord over Iraq , the summit demonstrated a new momentum in transatlantic security cooperation , and reinforced NATO &apos;s role as the major instrument for that cooperation .
the key decisions that we took at the summit make this very clear .
first , Afghanistan .
NATO decided in Istanbul to expand its stabilising presence .
we will increase the number of Provincial Reconstruction Teams in order to support the expansion of the central government &apos;s authority and facilitate development and reconstruction .
we will also provide enhanced support for the forthcoming elections , which are crucial to ensuring long-term peace and stability and making sure that the country will never again become a safe haven for terrorists .
second , Iraq .
at the request of Prime Minister Iyad Allawi , NATO decided to offer to help train Iraqi security forces .
in addition to our continued support for Poland in its leadership of the multinational division in Iraq , NATO will now play a distinct role in helping Iraq .
that this decision was taken in conjunction with the transfer of authority to a new Iraqi Government only adds to its significance .
the Allies affirmed unambiguously that a stable Iraq is in their common interest and that NATO is part of achieving this .
training is an area that is critical to Iraq &apos;s stability , and one in which NATO has valuable experience and expertise to share .
third , the Balkans .
while our presence in Kosovo remains unchanged , the much improved security situation in Bosnia and Herzegovina allows us to conclude our successful SFOR mission there by the end of this year .
the European Union will then follow with a mission of its own , and we will support the EU in this endeavor .
but NATO will retain a presence in Sarajevo , in particular to help Bosnia and Herzegovina with defense reform .
we want to welcome this country , as well as Serbia and Montenegro , into our Partnership for Peace program as soon as they meet the relevant criteria , which include full cooperation with the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia .
fourth , military transformation .
the allies decided to accelerate their efforts to equip NATO with the forces and technologies it needs to perform twenty-first century missions , from the Balkans to Afghanistan .
the NATO Response Force will soon achieve its initial operational capability , and our new Multinational Defense Battalion to deal with chemical , biological , radiological and nuclear threats is already fully operational - all ideas proposed by the United States , and implemented rapidly by the alliance .
in addition , we endorsed on several measures to strengthen the link between political agreement to commence operations and the provision of the necessary forces , including through usability targets and changes to NATO &apos;s planning processes .
we also launched a new phase in our relations with partner countries : opportunities for more individualized cooperation , a greater emphasis on defense reform , and a stronger focus on the Caucasus and Central Asia .
furthermore , we welcomed the interest shown by Russia and Ukraine in contributing to &quot; Active Endeavor , &quot; our anti-terrorist naval operation in the Mediterranean , as another sign of the growing strategic value of our partnership with these countries .
finally , the Mediterranean and the broader Middle East . NATO decided in Istanbul to reach out to new regions of strategic importance , in particular the broader Middle East .
no other region &apos;s development will affect our security more profoundly in coming years .
we need a coherent transatlantic effort to engage this region , and NATO will be part of that effort .
we agreed to strengthen our Mediterranean Dialogue with seven countries in North Africa and the Middle East and to transform it into a genuine partnership .
we also launched the &quot; Istanbul Cooperation Initiative , &quot; to offer practical security-related cooperation to countries in the broader Middle East .
several members of the Gulf Cooperation Council have already expressed an interest in working together with NATO , so we are off to a good start .
the NATO Istanbul summit was a strong demonstration of an Atlanticism that looks to the challenges of today and tomorrow and is prepared to tackle security challenges wherever they emerge .
the summit gave NATO more political and military means to project stability where it matters .
most importantly , the summit reaffirmed the role of the transatlantic community of democratic nations and shared values as the most powerful force for shaping our future .
when the Soviet Union collapsed , many predicted the end of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization ( NATO ) .
yet a few weeks ago , NATO held its summit meeting in the Latvian capital of Riga , formerly part of the USSR .
NATO was created in 1949 as an alliance to contain Soviet power .
its focus was on Western Europe , and , as one joke went , it was designed to keep the Russians out , the Germans down , and the Americans in .
but that Cold War world is long gone .
Germany is a democracy firmly anchored in the European Union , and there is no threat of Soviet tanks sweeping across the North German plains .
NATO survived by transforming itself .
while some Central European members that were formerly occupied by the USSR continue to see NATO as a political insurance policy against a revival of Russian ambitions , NATO is no longer aimed against Russia .
in fact , Russian officers are welcome to participate in military exercises and to visit NATO headquarters under the Partnership for Peace program .
residual suspicions and Russian pride limit the NATO-Russia agreement , but the organization is no longer focused on Russia .
one major task that NATO performed in the first decade after the Cold War was to attract the newly freed countries of Central Europe toward the West , with the prospect of membership conditioned on meeting democratic standards .
another important task was to help bring stability to the troubled Balkan region after the breakup of Yugoslavia and the resultant wars in Bosnia and Kosovo .
NATO peacekeeping operations have been a stabilizing factor in the region .
for example , NATO and EU diplomacy prevented ethnic conflict in Macedonia from erupting into a crisis .
while these actions were important , many observers argued that NATO would have to look beyond Europe .
a common quip was that NATO would have to go “ out of area or out of business . ”
this became particularly important after the Al Qaeda attacks on September 11 , 2001 , shifted the focus of American foreign policy toward transnational terrorism .
the European members of NATO responded by invoking the Article 5 mutual defense clause of the NATO charter and coming to the aid of the US in Afghanistan , where today there are 32,000 NATO troops .
because they train together , NATO countries can operate effectively even when not all members of the organization are officially involved .
for example , NATO did not conduct the Gulf War in 1991 or the initial Afghan campaign , but NATO planning and training meant that members could cooperate effectively when called upon to do so .
at the same time , NATO after Riga faces a number of problems .
Europe split over the American invasion of Iraq , and there is no political will to involve NATO there .
the new relationship with Russia needs careful management , and rapid extension of membership to former Soviet republics like Ukraine and Georgia could prove difficult .
in military terms , European countries need to spend more on secure communications , airlift capabilities , special operations , and dealing with chemical and biological battlefields in order to be able to fight the war on terrorism effectively .
France is concerned that America ’ s influence in NATO is too large , and opposes a global role in which NATO establishes special partnerships with Australia , New Zealand , Japan , and other countries .
the French worry that NATO ’ s global ambition , particularly in East Asia , could produce friction with China .
but by far the biggest problem that NATO faces today is Afghanistan .
Hamid Karzai ’ s government remains weak , and the economy continues to be heavily dependent upon opium production .
the Taliban and Al Qaeda networks are re-emerging as political and military threats .
many NATO countries with troops in Afghanistan have “ national caveats ” that restrict how their troops may be used .
while the Riga summit relaxed some of these caveats to allow assistance to allies in dire circumstances , Britain , Canada , the Netherlands , and the US are doing most of the fighting in southern Afghanistan , while French , German , and Italian troops are deployed in the quieter north .
it is difficult to see how NATO can succeed in stabilizing Afghanistan unless it is willing to commit more troops and give commanders more flexibility .
success will also require more funds for reconstruction , development , and alternatives to opium poppy cultivation .
governments in Europe and the US are concerned about budget problems , but in a larger perspective , providing significantly greater resources to Afghanistan now may turn out to save more funds later .
one of the great costs of the Bush administration ’ s mistaken Iraq policy has been to divert attention and resources away from the just war in Afghanistan .
if only a small portion of the money and forces invested in Iraq had been devoted to Afghanistan , the current threat of a resurgent Taliban and Al Qaeda might not be so great .
unfortunately , Iraq is draining all the oxygen out of the policy process in Washington .
few people are focused on saving NATO from a significant failure in its first major test outside of Europe .
hundreds of thousands of Romanians cheered President Bush as he welcomed us into NATO , and we meant it .
just like we meant it when we cheered Nicolae Ceausescu - both when he spoke and when he was executed . we are good at cheering .
what we are not good at is understanding what we are cheering for .
our new NATO membership sounds great , but we really don &apos;t know why .
in 1998 , Radu Vasile , then Romania &apos;s Prime Minister , visited Israel .
Vasile expressed interest in purchasing Israeli military helicopters .
Israel &apos;s President Ezer Weizmann , a former pilot , responded : &quot; you must have serious enemies if you need these helicopters .
who are they ? &quot;
&quot; not at all , &quot; Vasile answered , &quot; we &apos;re at peace with our neighbours ... our frontiers are secure .
but we need up-to-date aircraft ... to join NATO . &apos;
&quot; so , &quot; Weizmann said , &quot; you don &apos;t have any enemies after all !
but don &apos;t worry : NATO will find enemies for you ! &quot;
most Romanians see NATO membership as a huge national victory , but some wonder if there is truth in Weizmann &apos;s joke : because , if the rationale for entering a military alliance is that you feel threatened , entering NATO is nonsense .
for the first time in its troubled history , Romania has nothing to fear from its neighbours .
Russia , &quot; the hereditary enemy , &quot; now seems far away and consumed by its domestic troubles .
Hungary , the other &quot; hereditary enemy , &quot; is a fellow NATO ally ; relations with Ukraine are nasty , but peaceful .
Bulgaria is too small to matter ; and Yugoslavia &apos;s wars are over .
even so , the country must now , year after year , increase its military expenses so that it can begin to approximate NATO standards .
that will be a hard thing to do for an economy whose recent economic growth , though real , remains shaky .
unlike joining the EU , which can provide important development funds , joining NATO means only sacrifice .
given our poverty , spending more money on military equipment seems irresponsible .
although 73 % of Romanians approve of entering NATO , less than 20 % agree with Romanian participation in a war against Iraq .
no matter how inconsistent such attitudes appear to be , they remain widespread and cannot be overlooked , because they suggest that people here conceive of NATO as a protective umbrella , not something to which they must contribute .
Romania &apos;s security problems are not external , but internal , for the enemies of Romania establishing a stable , democratic-liberal government are the Romanian people themselves .
democracy here is a reality , but a delicate one .
too many dictatorships have accustomed Romanians with habits of obedience , conformity and irresponsibility .
the ruling PSD ( Social Democrat ) government is efficient , but has a worrying record of corruption , non-transparency , and of using its power to influence judicial decisions .
the second largest party - Greater Romania Party - is a half-fascist , xenophobic , anti-Semitic party , whose leader - a populist radical - received 22 % of the vote in last year &apos;s elections .
how can NATO help with this ?
directly , it can do nothing ; indirectly , it can do a lot .
NATO is no longer only a military alliance .
instead , it is now a military-political alliance that sets democratic standards for new members and aspirants .
no Romanian government can neglect these standards .
such openly thuggish rulers as Kuchma of Ukraine or Lukashenka of Belarus , are almost impossible to imagine in Romania nowadays .
moreover , joining NATO means subsuming Romania &apos;s military and intelligence services under NATO command ( i.e. American ) control , thus any attempt at staging a coup , or stirring up trouble between Romanians and our sizeable Hungarian minority , can be prevented .
the more tightly bound to the democratic world a country like Romania is , the less likely it is to experience dramatic social or political unrest or to eviscerate its democratic system .
NATO fixes hard limits on the autonomy of local political elites to do what they want .
of course , NATO cannot safeguard democracy alone and it is no panacea for our many social and political illnesses ; yet it can act ( and has already done so during the process of admission ) as an incentive for governments and parties to behave responsibly and to abide by the rule of law .
this is vital because , in the past , when Romania &apos;s political elites enjoyed too much autonomy or real national sovereignty , they abused it .
Ceausescu &apos;s rule demonstrates this .
the &quot; room to maneuver &quot; he carved from the Warsaw Pact with the support of the West brought no benefits to the Romanian people .
it only increased the opportunity for Ceausescu &apos;s clan and cronies to act arbitrarily , making the lives of most citizens hell .
comparatively , the Hungarians , the Polish and the Bulgarians , whose governments were much more dependent on the Soviets , were better off .
so , it is not joining NATO the military alliance that will benefit Romania .
what matters is Romania &apos;s integration into a strong international organisation , which will curb its sovereignty .
entering NATO marks a formal acknowledgement that Romania ( or Bulgaria , or Hungary , or Poland for that matter ) is surrendering its claims to unlimited sovereignty , and to all the dreams of grandeur that go with it .
in the past , those dreams brought only underdevelopment , dictatorship , nationalism and untold amounts of suffering .
killing that dream will prevent us from reliving our political nightmares .
Istanbul – Turkey joined NATO at the beginning of the Cold War to gain United States protection in the event of a Soviet attack .
back then , Turkey was clearly on the frontline ; today , however , its leaders are assertively pursuing an independent foreign and security policy , and their growing confidence is now testing the Alliance ’ s cohesion .
meanwhile , cooperation between NATO and the European Union remains stalled , owing to the dispute with Turkey over divided Cyprus .
moreover , in sharp contrast to the majority of NATO members , Turkey maintains that Iran and Syria should not be viewed as threats .
and , at the height of the Libyan crisis , while NATO officials were preparing operational plans to intervene , Turkey ’ s Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdoğan was speaking out against military action .
as a result , some now say that Turkey is turning its back on the West .
but it would be more accurate to say that Turkey is broadening its reach .
Turkey may indeed cause tensions within NATO , but its position represents an astute balance between loyalty to the Alliance and appropriate regard for its own national interests .
geopolitical changes like the end of the Cold War and , lately , the push for democracy in the Middle East , along with the desire to have “ zero problems ” with Turkey ’ s neighbors , have created new objectives for Turkish foreign-policy strategists .
indeed , Turkey ’ s leaders are downgrading the importance of “ hard power ” security issues in favor of enhancing the country ’ s soft power while also grasping economic opportunities .
a primary consequence of this “ de-securitization ” of Turkish foreign policy has been an altered balance of power between the country ’ s military and civilian establishments .
a no less important consequence is the changed relationship between Turkey and the West .
in years past , defense partnership constituted a pillar of Turkey ’ s relations with the West .
but it was an asymmetrical relationship , in which Turkey , as a consumer of security , was largely dependent on the West .
Turkey ’ s foreign-policy choices were constrained by the need to remain aligned with its security provider .
nowadays , however , declining threat perceptions have fundamentally altered this perspective , and reduced Turkey ’ s need to act in unison with the West .
moreover , Turkey ’ s shrinking pre-occupation with its territorial integrity has significantly diminished the West ’ s leverage .
the loosening of the security relationship has given Turkey greater latitude in foreign policy .
yet it would be wrong to argue that Turkey is pulling away from NATO .
Turkey is still an active and influential member , and hopes to benefit as much as possible from membership .
Turkey is committed to NATO , and its military budget more or less fulfills NATO ’ s defense-spending criterion of 2 % of GDP .
it also commits troops to NATO operations , notably to the ISAF operation in Afghanistan .
Turkey ’ s role within the Alliance is more active than that of the vast majority of other member states .
Turkey is pushing the alliance to adapt to new security challenges , yet it nonetheless remains steadfast in its adherence to NATO ’ s nuclear-sharing policies .
Turkey is one of the six NATO countries that have hosted US tactical nuclear weapons for more than 40 years , including 90 B61 gravity bombs .
the readiness of the nuclear weapons based on its territory – a matter of weeks or months rather than hours – provides little strategic value .
yet Turkey has always argued that a credible NATO nuclear deterrent is vital to the alliance ’ s collective defense .
indeed , Turkey ’ s position is now at odds with the three West European countries – Belgium , Germany , and the Netherlands – currently calling for a withdrawal of US nuclear weapons from their territory .
Turkey insists that such decisions cannot be taken unilaterally , and that a NATO-wide consensus is necessary to change this critical element of the alliance ’ s nuclear deterrence .
Turkey is also actively involved in NATO ’ s ongoing deterrence review , which aims to strike a balance between the Alliance ’ s nuclear and conventional capacities , and is also set to clarify the role of missile defense in this context .
Turkish officials say that they would not oppose any program that would strengthen NATO ’ s security .
but they fear the deployment of a missile-defense system exclusively targeting Turkey ’ s neighbors .
as a result , Turkey ’ s leaders have set out three conditions for acquiescing in such a program .
first , the system should take into consideration current security risks , based on the existing missile capabilities of non-NATO countries .
second , it should cover all of Turkey ’ s territory .
finally , because Turkey has no desire to be a frontline state in the Middle East , as it was during the Cold War , it strenuously objects to Iran and Syria being identified as direct threats .
today , Turkey sees its NATO membership as just one aspect of its wider security policy .
its government is seeking a strong role in world affairs , and consequently its policies have not always aligned with those of a majority of NATO members .
ultimately , though , Turkey ’ s leaders have no intention of undermining NATO ’ s cohesiveness and effectiveness .
on the contrary , their aim is to assert Turkey ’ s position in NATO so that the Alliance more closely mirrors their own objectives .
whoever thought that NATO - that most successful expression of transatlantic solidarity - had found new cohesion after the divisive Iraq crisis should visit the alliance &apos;s headquarters .
true , the Istanbul summit in late June produced a veneer of harmony , and NATO headquarters is , as usual , busying itself with frequent meetings of now 26 national delegations , innumerable committees , and the mountains of printed paper it churns out .
something essential , however , is missing : NATO &apos;s spirit .
many , if not most , of the members no longer recognize NATO as central to their national interest .
as one high official puts it , the organization is like the old and bruised car one keeps for as long as it functions but will dump when repairs get too costly .
there is still some use to be had from the old vehicle : it leads some 6000 troops in Afghanistan , assures a fragile security in Kosovo , and may , as was decided by NATO in June , be helpful in training Iraqi forces .
NATO is still nice to have around .
but , with the exception of those who have only just joined , few governments on either side of the Atlantic seem to fear major disaster if it gently faded away .
that , not the falling-out among major allies over the Iraq War , is the cause for the deep crisis the modern world &apos;s oldest and most successful alliance now finds itself in .
the policy differences over America &apos;s Iraq adventure exacerbated the crisis , but also obscured its true cause .
this explains why neither the US , nor its opponents or supporters in Europe , ever sought a thorough discussion of the operation in the NATO Council before , during , or after the Iraq war - they realized their views were already too far apart to be reconciled .
that is also why the modest efforts now being undertaken by the alliance to assist America in trying to stabilize Iraq will not stitch NATO back together again .
to be sure , the US administration has now asked all of NATO for help , in marked contrast to its haughty claim only two years ago that NATO as such no longer mattered ; not membership in the alliance , but a particular military mission , would henceforth define the coalition .
yet , for most of the allies , this new approach is merely tactical , a sign of Yankee pragmatism when the situation demands it , not of a change of heart on the part of the Bush administration to rebuild NATO as the central plank of the transatlantic partnership .
nor do European governments display any such urge .
summit communiqués have become modest if wordy affairs .
even where members have committed themselves to a joint operation , as in Afghanistan , NATO &apos;s able new Secretary General , former Dutch foreign minister Jaap de Hoop Scheffer , has to plead for a few helicopters here , a few hundred men there , like the manager of an impoverished football association trying to put together a team .
NATO &apos;s crisis of confidence and cohesion stems from the Cold War &apos;s end , not from the turbulences of the Iraq War .
the alliance can claim important achievements over the past 15 years : it helped to stabilize Europe as it enlarged to 26 members , almost double the Cold War number ; it kept the Balkan conflict under control ; it even accepted a role in extra-European security contingencies such as Afghanistan .
but NATO has failed the most important test , namely to ensure that its members continue to see its success as essential to their interests .
that they no longer do so is deeply disturbing .
it reflects less on the shortcomings of the organization than on the shortsightedness of its members .
true , their security from military attack is currently no longer at stake .
but NATO is more than just a defense pact .
like no other institution , NATO embodies Atlantic cohesion , something that remains essential for any Western effort to promote a degree of international order .
NATO links Europe to the world &apos;s most powerful country and uniquely ties the United States to a common procedure of consultation and cooperation .
moreover , it is the only organization capable of generating international military operations for the many stability-building tasks that lie ahead .
European governments , therefore , are crazy not to support NATO .
to watch it wither is at best frivolous , at worst dangerous .
instead of blaming the Bush administration and hoping for a change of government in the US , European members need to make NATO their own concern again .
this does not imply kowtowing to every American view and whim or foregoing efforts to strengthen European defense cooperation .
it does mean undertaking to make NATO again the place where both sides of the Atlantic develop a common approach to the dangers of this world .
unfortunately , most European governments merely shrug their shoulders when the issue is raised .
that dangerous indifference is the most serious sign of NATO &apos;s crisis .
Denver – US Secretary of Defense Robert Gates ’ s recent prognosis of a “ dim ” and “ dismal ” future for NATO has triggered much debate , but it could well prove optimistic .
June , it turns out , marks another milestone on the alliance ’ s uncertain path : its operation in Libya has now surpassed in length the one in Kosovo 12 years ago .
after 78 days in 1999 , Serbia ’ s Slobodan Milosevic gave up , while Libya ’ s Col. Muammar el-Qaddafi has yet to get the message – and may in fact be getting the wrong message .
for those of us who were engaged in the Kosovo crisis , the Libya intervention seems like déjà vu .
in the skies of Serbia and Kosovo , NATO warplanes attacked target after target , not to support the liberation of territory or in furtherance of a strategic bombing campaign , but rather to change Milosevic ’ s mind .
to be sure , denying Milosevic the means to engage in “ ethnic cleansing ” was added as a rationale in the days after the campaign began , but the real purpose was to convince him that he had to allow NATO forces into Kosovo .
it was a classic strategy / policy mismatch .
no war is without its list of false assumptions , and the Kosovo campaign had its share .
perhaps the most important was the memorable – but erroneous – view that Milosevic would give up after a few days of bombing .
instead , like many a leader in such circumstances , he entered a bunker , both figuratively and literally , and stayed there with little communication .
meanwhile , NATO planners desperately sought to identify targets that would either deny him the means of ethnic cleansing , or , more often , encourage him to reconsider his position .
the intervention had its low points , perhaps none lower than the bombing of the Chinese Embassy , which was misidentified as a building that housed Serbian security assets – instruments of repression against Kosovo .
there were also moments of great concern about whether the allies would be willing to stay the course as the days , weeks , and months passed , with no end in sight .
surely , those engaged in Libya today are feeling some of those same pressures .
back in March 1999 , few NATO leaders doubted that removing Milosevic from Kosovo by force was the right thing to do .
nor was there much doubt that the leaders of Europe and the United States had made a good-faith effort to convince Milosevic through negotiations and peaceful means .
war was a last resort .
indeed , by March 1999 , the decision to go to war was understood to be correct , because all other possibilities had been exhausted .
the nineteenth-century Prussian military theorist Carl von Clausewitz is ( too ) often cited for his dictum that war is a continuation of politics by other means .
but a more pertinent thought of his came to mind during those days of decision : war is a serious means to serious ends .
nobody involved in the Kosovo operation thought otherwise , or entertained the idea that NATO could give up .
that is why NATO began to assemble a ground component .
ground troops ultimately proved unnecessary , but failure was not an option .
nor can it be an option today .
in Libya , there is also a strategy / policy mismatch .
the policy is to remove Qaddafi from power .
the strategy – that is , the mandate for the means – is to protect civilians .
the latter will not ensure the success of the former .
this gap is beginning to close as NATO begins to deploy assets , such as attack helicopters , aimed more directly and boldly at the real goal of removing Qaddafi from power .
but far more needs to be done to ensure success .
complaints about the fecklessness of the rebels are not going to help .
Libya ’ s opposition is what it is .
Gates has appropriately focused on the question of NATO ’ s financial sustainability .
as European military leaders engaged in the operation discuss publicly the limitations of their budgets , it is easy to see why he raised the issue .
( note to European military leaders : please don ’ t signal to Qaddafi that you are running out of bombs . )
but another point made by Gates is far more serious : lack of political will .
some countries with needed capabilities have not brought them to the fight , and others have not even provided political support .
this à la carte approach is how NATO has always worked .
what is new is the possibility that NATO will fail .
the alliance ’ s reluctant warriors ought to consider that risk as they stand on the sideline .
these are difficult days for NATO , as Gates , in the twilight of his illustrious tenure , has pointed out .
a decision was made to engage militarily in a situation of arguably marginal interest , but now all of the allies must understand that they are using serious means to a serious end .
all of the countries that took the decision to intervene in Libya , including the US , must conduct themselves with a sense of renewed vigor , and with the understanding that NATO – whatever its shortcomings and shortfalls – must prevail .
new DELHI – The agreement at the NATO summit meeting in Lisbon on a transition plan to help end the war in Afghanistan within the next four years raises troubling questions about regional security and the global fight against transnational terrorism .
as the US and other coalition partners gradually wind down their combat role , Afghan security forces – to number 300,000 after crash training of new recruits – are to take their place .
but these local forces are unlikely to be able to hold the country together .
the most likely post-war scenario is a partition of Afghanistan , with the Taliban calling the shots in the Pashtun-dominated south and east , and the non-Pashtun northern and western regions retaining their current de facto autonomy .
regionally , there is likely to be greater turmoil .
the withdrawal of NATO forces before the job is done will leave India on the front lines to face the brunt of greater terror from the Afghanistan-Pakistan belt . in fact , NATO ’ s retreat is expected to embolden jihadists in the region – and beyond it – to stage transnational attacks .
the 2014 withdrawal plan , however , comes as no surprise , given US President Barack Obama ’ s expressed desire to end combat operations in Afghanistan .
indeed , his defense secretary , Robert Gates , made clear last year that the US will now seek to contain terrorism regionally rather than defeat it .
the transition plan cements that strategic shift .
the problem , however , is that the US war effort is already faltering , with Afghan President Hamid Karzai exploring the possibility of cutting his own deals with the Taliban and other warlords .
and that is largely the result of Obama ’ s botched strategy , whose twin troop surges were designed not to rout the Taliban militarily , but to strike a political deal with them from a position of strength .
but , as CIA director Leon Panetta admitted , “ We have seen no evidence that &#91; the Taliban &#93; are truly interested in reconciliation . ”
why would the Taliban be interested in negotiating a deal with the Americans , given Obama ’ s public declaration , just weeks after coming to office , that he was interested in a military exit from Afghanistan ?
the Afghan Taliban and their sponsors , the Pakistan military , simply want to wait out the Americans .
last year , with the stroke of his pen , Obama ended his predecessor ’ s “ global war on terror . ”
but renaming it a “ struggle ” or a “ strategic challenge ” has not changed the grim realities on the ground .
the US has been lucky to escape further terrorist strikes since September 11 , 2001 , despite several attempts .
by contrast , India ’ s location next to the Af-Pak has left it far more vulnerable , and the country has since suffered a series of major attacks – from the assault on its parliament in December 2001 to the terrorist siege of Mumbai in 2008 .
Afghanistan and Pakistan , two artificially created states with no roots in history , have searched endlessly for a national identity .
today , they have emerged as the global epicenter of transnational terrorism and the heroin trade .
although Pakistan is now the largest recipient of US aid in the world , the Failed States Index2010 , created by Foreign Policy and the Fund for Peace , ranks the country 10th , between Guinea and Haiti .
unlike in other failed states , however , in Pakistan state-nurtured terrorism and state-supported nuclear smuggling uniquely intersect .
to compound the situation , the political border between Afghanistan and Pakistan has now ceased to exist in practice .
the 2,640-kilometer Durand Line , a British-colonial invention that divided the large Pashtun community when it was established in 1893 as the border between British-led India and Afghanistan , has long been despised and rejected by Afghanistan .
today , the Durand Line exists only on maps .
on the ground , it has little political , ethnic , or economic relevance , even as the Af-Pak region has become a magnet for the world ’ s jihadists .
a de facto Pashtunistan , long sought by Pashtuns , has now grown up on the ruins of an ongoing Islamist militancy , but without any political authority in charge .
the disappearance of the Af-Pak political border seems irreversible , undermining Pakistan ’ s own territorial integrity .
yet , as if the forces of terror could be neatly boxed in , the US has scaled back its objective to contain terrorism regionally – a strategy that promises to keep the Af-Pak problem a festering threat to global security .
indeed , NATO ’ s withdrawal plan is likely to lead to a realignment of ethnic forces , and thus to greater volatility .
Afghanistan is not Vietnam .
a withdrawal of US and other NATO troops will not mean the end of the war , because the enemy will continue to target Western interests , wherever they may be .
the hope that terrorism can be regionally contained is a dangerous exercise in self-delusion .
Copenhagen – Two dangerous signals were sent from NATO ’ s Bucharest summit .
the first was that Russia has reestablished a “ sphere of interest ” in Europe , where countries are no longer allowed to pursue their own goals without Moscow accepting them .
the other was that all NATO member states are free to blackmail their partners into supporting their own narrow goals .
the first signal was sent when Ukraine and Georgia were denied the “ Membership Action Plan ” ( MAP ) that they sought .
several European heavyweights , led by Germany and France , said no , despite strong support for the idea from the United States .
the second signal was sent when Greece successfully vetoed membership for Macedonia , a move that reflected the two countries ’ unresolved conflict over Macedonia ’ s name ( which Greece insists must be Former Yugoslav Republic Of Macedonia – FYROM – one of the most disgraceful acronyms harassing international politics today ) .
the dispute with Macedonia goes back to the early 1990 ’ s , when Yugoslavia collapsed into independent states .
Greece vehemently opposed its tiny northern neighbor – with only two million inhabitants – using the name Macedonia and symbols from the days of Alexander the Great in its flag and crest .
Macedonia at one point agreed to design a new flag and remove the symbols , as well as to amend its constitution to clarify that it had no territorial claims on Greece , but it flatly refused to live under one of the tongue-twisting names suggested by its bigger neighbor .
so there you are : a Greek veto on Macedonia ’ s national aspirations until it has chosen a name that does not make the Greeks shiver in fear of aggression from the north .
it sounds ridiculous , but there is another , often overlooked , aspect to the dispute : by behaving as it has , Greece is demonstrating a lack of confidence in its NATO partners .
with Macedonia in NATO , any adventurous policy that undermined regional stability would certainly be stopped in its tracks .
if the Greeks cannot see that , their partners must let them know that there is a price for their obstructive behavior .
the problem with Ukraine and Georgia is far more serious .
in a sense , Russia has behaved like Greece in claiming that NATO enlargement threatens its security .
that is nonsense , and Russia knows it .
but the Kremlin has found that behaving like a spoiled child gets results : the right to influence developments in ex-Soviet countries .
in other words , Russia is being allowed to re-assert its “ sphere of influence ” – a concept that should have been superceded by that of “ Europe Whole and Free , ” which the entire European Union appeared to have embraced when communism collapsed .
but no : 1989 was not the end of history .
history threatens to return .
European opponents of a MAP for Ukraine and Georgia argue that neither country is ready for NATO membership .
too many question marks about their national unity are said to exist , too many internal conflicts linger , and their records on political and judicial reforms are supposedly dubious .
but the MAP process does not imply an automatic right to NATO membership .
on the contrary , MAPs would put heavy demands on Ukraine and Georgia .
both would have to answer a lot of difficult questions and convince others that they are able to live up to NATO ’ s democratic requirements before being allowed to join .
therefore , it would also be in Russia ’ s interest to see such a process started .
Russia has valid concerns regarding the huge Russian-speaking minorities in both countries , and these concerns are best dealt within the framework of the MAP process , where the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe ’ s very strict rules on treatment of minorities provide the benchmark .
indeed , the MAP process ensured protections for Russian minorities in Estonia , Latvia , and Lithuania – all ex-Soviet republics that are now NATO members .
the crux of the matter is Europe ’ s lack of political will to forge a unified stand toward Russia .
this has led Russia to pursue a classic “ divide and rule ” strategy by tempting some big European countries into bilateral agreements – particularly on energy issues – that preclude a common EU position .
this is sad – both for Russia and Europeans – because it strengthens the hand of those in Moscow who want to pursue a policy of national pride rather than national interest , and it weakens the possibilities of establishing a real common European foreign and security policy .
but it is saddest for the countries that are once again being left out in the cold .
NATO is supposed to be a beacon for countries struggling to establish democracy and freedom .
the Bucharest summit suggests that the beacon has been switched off .
Berlin : NATO ’ s next summit will take place in Prague in the winter of 2002 – that is , if President Bush doesn ’ t call his allies together before then .
but the questions to be answered leading up to the summit are already clear : which , if any , country will be asked to join Nato ; when will any new member join ?
whatever decisions are taken , it is also clear that preparatory work must begin as soon as possible , and at least before the end of the year .
all this is different from 1997 , when Poland , Hungary and the Czech Republic joined Nato .
back then , the outcome of the Madrid summit that agreed to their membership was uncertain until the final moments .
that uncertainty ended when America succeeded in limiting invitations to three chosen countries , surprising those Alliance members who supported other candidates .
today , the most important issue facing Nato concerns whether or not to admit the Baltic states – Estonia , Latvia , and Lithuania – now , after some delay , or never .
turning down or delaying Baltic state membership will be seen as a concession to Russia ; acting in their favor will be regarded by Moscow as a slap-in-the-face .
no matter what decision Nato takes , containing the negative fall-out – in Russia or the Baltics – will not be easy .
so a surprise conclusion in the manner of Madrid will only make matters worse , because careful preparations will be needed to contain the damage , and too much time will be lost if everything is put off until the meeting in Prague .
some Nato members hope to evade these problems altogether through delay .
why not postpone enlargement , they ask , until some of the states demanding to join Nato have gained EU membership , where elements of their security concerns may be met ?
but postponement is not a viable option , for the following reasons :
- Russia itself placed membership for the Baltic three atop Nato ’ s agenda .
time and again Moscow has thundered that Nato ’ s first eastward enlargement must be its last .
bringing the Baltic states into Nato , Russia claims , would severely compromise its security ( for that read Russian self-esteem ) .
the strength of these protests , however , will make dawdling over Nato enlargement appear as a kowtow to President Putin ;
- The West promised to continue enlargement at the Washington Summit of April 1999 .
back then Nato heads-of-state welcomed the progress of various candidate countries , commending the Baltic states in particular .
NATO ’ s leaders also promised to revisit enlargement by 2002 at the latest .
so they cannot repeat the same formula in Prague and remain credible in both Russia and Eastern Europe ;
- EU enlargement takes time while Nato enlargement is relatively speedy .
were negotiations over EU-admission of the Baltics near conclusion , postponing Nato-membership could be justified because the EU , with its new defense identity , is now both a security and prosperity union .
as EU members , the Baltic states would indirectly come under Nato ’ s security shield , making explicit membership unnecessary perhaps .
unfortunately , years will elapse before negotiations over EU membership will conclude and be ratified .
stalling until that time is postponement by other means .
- At the Cold War ’ s end , Nato redefined itself as a stability network for all the Euro-Atlantic community , which includes Eastern Europe ’ s new democracies .
arguments which say that , because no direct security risk exists there is no need for a Nato guarantee of the Baltics – a view that sometimes gains attention in Berlin – break with this redefinition .
even if some Nato members want to distance themselves from this strategy , the Bush Administration unambiguously supports Nato ’ s role as a stability network .
neither putative EU membership nor today ’ s favorable security conditions justify postponing enlargement .
diplomatic tricks cannot finesse the issue .
NATO must either say “ Yes ” or “ No ” to the Baltic states .
( to be precise , Nato must treat the applications of all three Baltic countries together .
if only one were invited to join as a symbol of western determination , Russia would interpret this as appeasement , not steadfastness )
if Nato says “ Yes ” to the Baltics , it must make both Moscow and the Baltic three understand that enlargement is meant to increase stability along Russia ’ s western border , not threaten Russia .
as a signal to both , Nato ’ s military presence in the Baltics should be kept to a minimum .
in addition , the prospect of a democratic Russia eventually joining Nato might be openly acknowledged .
both must be done before any new enlargement is announced .
if Nato rejects the Baltic states it will need to prevent Moscow from interpreting that decision as confirmation that Estonia , Latvia , and Lithuania remain locked within Russia ’ s sphere of influence and that its Great Power posturing has paid off .
both inferences are potentially disastrous , not only for relations between West and Eastern Europe but , more importantly , for relations between Russia and the West .
Russia must be persuaded to confirm – explicitly and formally – the right of the Baltics , on their own , to choose their allies .
in view of Moscow ’ s insistence that it will never accept such a decision , this will not be easy .
moreover , if Nato membership for the Baltics is rejected , they will need reassurance that the West will assist them , concretely , should their security be put at risk .
admission or postponement are both legitimate decisions .
but each will require considerable early efforts to reduce their fall-out .
in weighing these options , admission of the Baltic countries quickly seems the better solution .
efforts to contain the damage caused by postponement will likely be far more demanding than any effort needed to ease tension after enlargement is announced .
moreover , at the next Summit following Prague , the Baltics must be at any rate be granted what , in view of their history , they have every right to demand : to be part of a stability alliance that is a matter of course for western democracies .
can NATO play a role in the struggle against international terrorism ?
will the Atlantic Alliance be able to defend our safety and security in a radically altered strategic environment ?
can the old dog learn new tricks ?
next week , NATO heads of state and government will answer these questions with an unequivocal &quot; yes . &quot;
the months since the terrorist attacks on New York and Washington have been characterized by intense transatlantic debate .
no holds were barred .
some Americans argued that the US no longer needed allies .
some Europeans argued that the US was irreversibly bent on unilateralism .
both views are wrong , and the Prague NATO summit will demonstrate why .
the summit will bring home to even the greatest skeptics that when it comes to managing our long-term security , there is no alternative to Europe and North America acting together .
tackling Terrorism : the events of September 11 th , 2001 clearly invalidated the conventional wisdom that terrorists want a lot of people watching , not a lot of people dead .
once a largely domestic concern , terrorism has become a major threat to international security .
this is why NATO will help tackle terrorism .
the invocation of NATO &apos;s collective self-defense obligation on September 12 th , 2001 was only the beginning .
a new NATO military concept for defense against terrorism will now follow , supported by the development of specific counter-terrorism capabilities .
we will further increase our cooperation in preventing the spread of weapons of mass destruction and in dealing with the consequences should prevention fail .
in short , NATO will become the focus for coordinating and planning the multinational military contribution to our defense against terrorism and other new threats .
enhancing Military Capabilities : military capability is the crucial underpinning of our safety and security .
it translates directly into political credibility .
but we need capabilities that are different from those needed during the Cold War .
we need forces that react more quickly , reach further , and can remain in the field longer .
enhancing NATO &apos;s capabilities will thus prove to be the litmus test for the future of the Alliance . NATO will pass this test .
a new NATO Response Force will bring together the most advanced forces within the Alliance for taking ultra-quick action against new security threats .
we will address shortfalls in our military posture through specific national commitments .
Re-prioritization , less duplication , and better armaments cooperation are further steps that will ensure that the Alliance retains its military edge .
we will also see to it that our efforts tie in with steps by the European Union to bolster its military capabilities .
inviting New Members : the venue of the Prague summit--the capital of one of NATO &apos;s most recent member states--is a powerful symbol of the Alliance &apos;s success in advancing Europe &apos;s unification .
but this job is not yet complete .
that is why , at Prague , we will invite additional countries to join .
this will end Europe &apos;s Cold War division for good and foreclose any return to the darker chapters of the continent &apos;s past .
admission of new members will repeat the positive experience of the last enlargement round .
countries that will receive invitations to join NATO during the Prague Summit will have had years of experience working with the Alliance as partners , notably in bringing peace and stability to the Balkans and Southeast Europe .
moreover , each will have benefited from several years of NATO-assisted defense reform .
they will thus be net security contributors rather than mere consumers , making our Alliance even stronger .
deepening Partnerships : the attacks of &quot; 9 / 11 &quot; were masterminded by a Saudi who lived in Central Asia , planned by people from the Eastern and Southern shores of the Mediterranean living in Western Europe , and carried out in North America .
these facts illustrate better than anything the need for security partnerships that extend to Central Asia and across the Mediterranean .
these partnership mechanisms already exist .
at Prague , we will make them even more effective .
we will focus much more on combating terrorism together .
we will intensify our cooperation on security sector reform .
by enabling meetings in more flexible formats , we will make our partnership mechanisms even more responsive to the interests and concerns of each individual partner country .
enhancing NATO-Russia Relations : once upon a time , most people in the West looked at Russia as part of the security problem .
no longer .
today , in a strategic environment marked by terrorism and the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction , Russia is very much part of the solution .
if the Prague summit will not showcase any grand new initiative , it is simply because we already launched a new NATO-Russia relationship last May at our special summit in Rome .
the new NATO-Russia Council created in Rome offers us an effective and flexible mechanism for joint analysis , joint decisions , and even joint action .
much has already been achieved over the past six months to transform the political message of Rome into practical cooperation .
it was Henry Kissinger who argued after the terrorist attacks on New York and Washington of 2001 that tragedy could be turned into opportunity .
NATO has been heeding this insight .
with stronger capabilities , new members , and deepened partnerships , the Alliance will demonstrate that it remains the premier instrument to address current and future security challenges .
at Prague , this message will ring out loud and clear .
the current discussion surrounding an international force for southern Lebanon has focused almost exclusively on which countries and organizations – NATO , the European Union , the United Nations – will provide the troops .
this is an important issue , to be sure , but the real question concerns the changes that Israel must undertake in exchange for this force being put in place and assuming the risk of such a mission .
no international force will simply protect Israel from Hezbollah rockets while Israel continues its current strategy . after all , the recent military escalation in the region is at least partly due to that strategy .
if an international force simply allows Ehud Olmert ’ s government to pursue its plans further , the countries that provide troops for the international force will not only be seen as rubberstamping Israeli policy , but will also be dragged into its failure .
to criticize Israel ’ s strategy as flawed is not to condone the acts of Hamas or Hezbollah or to deny Israel ’ s right to self-defense .
it is merely to point out what should be obvious : Israel ’ s efforts to find a unilateral solution to its security problems – whether occupation , withdrawal , or separation – have failed .
unilateral occupation without commitment to a viable Palestinian state has produced only the intifada and suicide bombers .
unilateral withdrawal from Gaza without the prior establishment of a local authority to maintain order has only led to renewed intervention .
and the “ security fence , ” which was to allow for unilateral separation , may hold back suicide bombers but not modern missiles of the kind currently employed by Hezbollah .
so far , the only lesson Israel seems to have drawn from its failed strategies is that it must extend and intensify the use of unilateral force : re-invade Gaza , devastate Lebanon , and threaten Syria and , by implication , Iran , which the Israeli government hints , had a hand in orchestrating the recent crisis .
it takes little foresight , however , to predict that more force will not produce more security for Israel .
the policy , reminiscent of terrorist stratagems , of bombing civilians in order to force the hands of their leaders will only strengthen the radicals and boost their popular support .
it will not hide the fact that Israel has run out of unilateral options .
Israel has so far been unwilling to accept this fact .
instead , its leaders hope that a robust international force in southern Lebanon will provide protection for northern Israel , leaving them with a free hand to deal unilaterally with Gaza and the West Bank , while committing the international community to Israel ’ s failed unilateralism .
to join such an international force under these conditions would be irresponsible .
countries that contribute troops would appear to be siding unequivocally with Israel , thereby losing all credibility with Israel ’ s adversaries .
they would also risk being drawn into renewed Israeli operations against Hezbollah and its backers .
most important , they would forego what may be the last chance to promote a consensual peace .
so the prior condition for setting up and joining an international force for Southern Lebanon must be that Israel renews its commitment to the “ road map ” and negotiations with the Palestinians for a viable Palestinian state .
with this aim in mind , it must enter into talks with democratically elected Palestinian representatives .
true , such talks will be difficult , and they may not succeed .
but that can no longer be an argument against diplomacy now that Israeli unilateralism has once again proven to be a strategic blind alley .
only an Israel seriously willing to seek security through agreement , not one that wants to impose her security on her neighborhood by fiat , can be partner to an international effort to bring stability to Lebanon and beyond .
of course , some countries , not least the US , would oppose making such a reversal in Israeli policy a condition of creating an international force and consensus in NATO , the EU , or the UN may not be found or , if it were to emerge , Israel might simply refuse to abide .
both prospects would be reason enough for staying away from the project altogether .
creating an international force for southern Lebanon makes sense only as an investment in regional peace , not as an appendix to Israel ’ s current strategy .
the arrest of 17 people in Canada on terrorist charges underscores , across the West , a growing sense of dread and inevitability that is rooted in the homegrown nature of the threat .
but what do we really know about these killers among us ?
we know , of course , the broad outline of their all-encompassing fundamentalism , and we have some vague ideas about Al Qaeda as a decentralized network of cells in many countries that seeks to acquire chemical , biological , and perhaps even nuclear weapons .
we also know their leaders ’ long-term goals : seize power in Muslim countries and attack the Western states that support secular regimes in the Islamic world .
finally , we also know that the leaders of this fanatical tide are few , but now have the sympathy of millions of ordinary Muslims .
there have always been fanatical individuals ready to die and kill in the name of their beliefs .
but they seem far more dangerous nowadays as a result of technological advances that have “ democratized ” bomb making .
after all , as the London and Madrid bombings demonstrated , a cell phone is all that is needed to time an explosion – or a series of explosions – with deadly efficiency .
our freedoms and social fluidity also contribute to the threat .
people move about the globe cheaply and with relative ease .
immigrants can establish themselves in new societies , and in democratic states they can live completely free of supervision .
our freedoms are their tools .
so how do we fight such an amorphous enemy ?
President George W. Bush has demonstrated one way not to do it : his invasion and occupation of Iraq show that directly attacking Muslim states only fuels fanaticism .
of course , civilized countries should not give up the fight against extremist Islam because of the bloodshed in Iraq ; but we must recognize that war , occupation , and forced submission to military power have merely caused mass humiliation and resentment among many ordinary Muslims – emotions that are then channeled into terrorist networks .
Prime Minister Tony Blair can loudly proclaim that the London bombings of July last year are unrelated to Britain ’ s participation in the Iraq war , but the terrorists themselves , once arrested , said exactly the opposite .
indeed , here is how one of the Madrid bombers described the psychological preparation to which he had been submitted : his leader “ made us watch DVDs showing pictures of war in Iraq , mostly pictures of women and children killed by American and British soldiers . ”
there is also no shortage of images of abused prisoners at the Abu Ghraib prison or the prison camp at Guantanamo Bay , which have likewise done more to recruit new adherents to Islamic fanaticism than any sermon in a radical mosque .
simply put , bombs dropped from several thousands meters do not kill less indiscriminately than explosive charges placed in train cars .
acknowledging this is not to excuse terrorism , but it is a first step toward understanding terrorism ’ s underlying causes , and thus toward their elimination .
above all , it is to acknowledge that democratic societies must use both political and police tactics in confronting fanatical terrorists .
politics is necessary for the simple reason that occupying armies and police cannot force hundreds of millions of Muslims to shed their hostility .
political action implies actually leaving Iraq quickly and finding a fair solution to the Palestinian conflict , which in turn requires ending the occupation of all Palestinian territories .
of course , extinguishing these hot spots will not erode the fanaticism of diehard and suicidal activists ; nor will it rid us of the avidity and hatred that is so evident among the leaders of Islamic rage .
but it will deprive them of the masses of sympathetic Muslims who view the fanatics as the only people seeking to defend “ Islamic ” values and oppressed Muslim peoples .
policing is the second part of any effective strategy .
greater efforts at infiltrating terror networks are needed , as is a deeper knowledge of the social structures created by the terrorists , in order to block their financial support .
this may mean eliminating shadowy “ tax havens , ” tapping phone lines , and identifying individuals considered highly dangerous .
police actions must be merciless , even if this means more controls and surveillance .
it is precisely to prevent the development of a collective security fear that we need to alter the equilibrium between security and freedom .
while the European Union lags behind the US in terms of conventional weapons , its capacity to fight terrorism is probably higher .
for historical reasons , Europe benefits from a political maturity that has allowed it to avoid Bush ’ s Manichean worldview , which has merely reinforced , rather than undermined , the enemy ’ s fanaticism .
moreover , for geographical reasons , Europe also benefits from a better knowledge of Arab and Muslim countries and extensive familiarity with their populations .
the West can and must prevail in this fight and in the defense of the values that it cherishes .
it might even find , along the way , a new and urgently needed motivation to reinforce its fraying unity .
nature &apos;s awesome powers have been on frightening display lately .
as world leaders gather in Johannesburg to discuss global environmental threats , many parts of the planet are battered by floods , droughts , harvest failures , massive forest fires , and even new diseases .
man &apos;s relationship to nature is a theme as old as our species , but that relationship is changing in complex ways .
the most important result of the Johannesburg Summit should be a recognition that more scientific research and much more global cooperation is needed .
floods and droughts have been scourges from ancient times , yet the frequency , size , and economic impact of these disasters has grown in recent years .
insurance claims against natural disasters rose to unprecedented levels during the 1990s , suggesting that the social costs of environmental upheavals have intensified .
climate shocks such as the fierce El Nino of 1997-98 played a major role in recent economic upheavals .
Indonesia and Ecuador , among other countries , succumbed to financial crises in 1997-98 that were linked ( in part ) to agricultural crises caused by the severe El Nino .
part of the growing climate effect results from our sheer numbers .
largely as a result of technological successes in the past 200 years , the human population has grown seven-fold since 1800 , from around 900 million in 1800 to more than 6 billion people today , crowding humanity into vulnerable spots throughout the world .
more than 2 billion of the world &apos;s 6 billion people live within 100 kilometers of a coastline , and so are vulnerable to ocean storms , flooding , and rising sea levels due to global warming .
hundreds of millions more live in fragile habitats on the steep slopes of mountains , or in semi-deserts , or in rain-fed regions where crops fail regularly when rain doesn &apos;t arrive .
human beings are also changing the environment everywhere , often in ways that make societies more vulnerable .
this is especially the case in impoverished countries . the increasing population density in rural Africa , with its intensification of farming , is leading to massive soil depletion .
when drought comes to Southern Africa , as it has this year , tens of millions of impoverished peasant families struggle for survival .
because African poverty contributed to the uncontrolled spread of AIDS , the combination of climate shocks and epidemic disease is devastating .
millions of AIDS orphans in Southern Africa live with grandparents too old and weak to produce food or to secure it .
because of the onset of the El Nino , it &apos;s likely that the drought will continue into the coming year .
the most remarkable feature of these environmental changes is that they are not limited to local environments .
for the first time in human history , human society is undermining the environment at the global scale , through climate change , extinctions , and degraded ecosystems .
man-made global warming , caused mainly by fossil-fuel burning in rich countries , may well be a factor in the frequency and severity of major droughts , floods , and tropical storms .
the frequency and intensity of the El Nino cycle in the past 25 years may also be the result of global warming .
China &apos;s heavy floods in recent years are partly the result , it seems , of the excessive melting of mountain snows on the Tibetan Plateau , which was caused by higher temperatures .
these growing environmental risks are complex .
the effects of environmental change may occur only after many years and may be felt halfway around the world .
or the effects may be indirect . land use changes , say , can amplify the spread of infectious diseases by changing the mix of species or the ways that animals and humans interact .
politicians are inept at handling such problems , so environmental risks continue to grow without adequate changes in public policy .
when disasters hit ( such as this year &apos;s droughts or floods ) , politicians cannot be held accountable for mistakes made over the course of many decades .
the summit in Johannesburg can draw the world &apos;s attention to these pressing problems .
even if the summit produces few specific results , it can make a difference if three demands are made of the summiteers :
we should insist that the world &apos;s politicians recognize the overwhelming scientific evidence that points to the major environmental perils humanity faces ;
we should press these leaders to invest more public money in basic environmental research and in the development of new technologies to address environmental risks .
for example , investments in research on alternative energy systems that can limit global warming are vital ;
third , we should insist that our politicians agree to greater international environmental cooperation , lest the neglectful and shortsighted policies within each nation end up destroying the global ecosystem .
on the face of it , the donor conference of Western and oil-rich Arab nations in Paris this week merely continues the work of two previous multilateral conferences in 2001 and 2002 , aimed at helping Lebanon to rebuild its infrastructure after years of civil war and Israeli occupation and to tackle its massive debt .
this time , donors will additionally help offset the $ 3.5 billion in direct and indirect losses caused by last summer ’ s war between Israel and Hezbollah , and the further rise of debt to $ 40.6 billion , a staggering 180 % of Lebanon ’ s GDP .
the agenda appears straightforward , but “ Paris III ” has acquired a barely concealed political purpose : to bolster the government of Lebanese Prime Minister Fouad Siniora in the face of a powerful domestic challenge led by Hezbollah , and by extension to curb the influence of Hezbollah ’ s regional backers , Syria and Iran .
the West should tread carefully .
there is a real risk that it will become entangled as a partisan actor in Lebanese domestic politics .
nor should it seek to play into the regional agendas of Saudi Arabia , Egypt , and Jordan – hardly paragons of democracy – which are anxious to confront what they portray as a menacing “ arc ” of Shi ’ a Muslim power extending from Iran to Lebanon via Syria , and in Iraq .
consider this .
the United States and France , which have taken the West ’ s lead on Lebanon , have both confirmed the “ democratic and constitutional nature ” of the Siniora government .
this is true , but only up to a point , for Lebanon ’ s confessional-based political system assigns the Shi ’ a , who make up close to 40 % of the population , only 21 % of parliamentary seats .
the Sunnis , who comprise at most 20 % of the population , are given the state office with the greatest executive power , that of prime minister .
furthermore , the Sunni-based , anti-Syrian Future Movement to which Siniora belongs effectively extended this inequity into the present parliament when it overrode the opposition and insisted on conducting the 2005 general elections on the basis of the Electoral Law gerrymandered by Syria in 2000 .
the West should therefore be wary of dismissing the Lebanese opposition out of hand as the cat ’ s paw of Syria and Iran .
rather , it should welcome proposals by Arab League mediators for immediate electoral reform and early parliamentary elections .
at the same time , it should expect the opposition to endorse the establishment of an international tribunal to adjudicate the matter of the assassination of former Prime Minister Rafiq Hariri , albeit after clarifying and narrowing the current excessively broad United Nations rules governing the investigation .
the West should also recognize that the constituencies of Hezbollah and its allied , largely Christian , Free Patriotic Movement , led by presidential contender Michel Aoun , will be hit hardest by many of Siniora ’ s proposed economic and administrative reforms , such as lifting fuel subsidies and sharply raising value added tax .
already the 200,000-member Federation of Labour Unions has joined the opposition bandwagon , and Siniora ’ s proposals will further fuel grassroots populist nationalism .
all this might be seen as a predictable , conservative reaction to urgently needed reforms , were it not for the poor track record of the Sunni economic establishment , which for many years adapted well enough to Syrian domination .
part of Hariri ’ s legacy was the award of quasi-monopolistic licences to cronies – for mobile telephones , for example – and the sale of government debt at highly profitable rates to local banks in which had a direct interest .
so were the profligate borrow-and-spend policies and the use of public-sector hiring to co-opt political factions , both of which resulted in Lebanon ’ s massive debt problem .
yet the real challenge for Western policy in Lebanon is neither constitutional reform nor establishment of the Hariri tribunal .
the Siniora government and the opposition are likely to reach a compromise within the next few months , probably on the basis of some variant of Arab League proposals .
the tougher challenge is to solve the Gordian knot that binds Hezbollah ( and the issue of its disarmament ) , Syria , and Israel together in a fateful triangle .
in short , the West needs to pre-empt a resumption of hostilities in Lebanon by seeking unconditional talks between Syria and Israel over the Golan Heights .
failing that , Paris III will represent a sidestepping of the key political issues that must be addressed , and thus merely stock up trouble for the future .
new YORK – India ’ s great moral leader Mohandas Gandhi famously said that there is enough on Earth for everybody ’ s need , but not enough for everybody ’ s greed .
today , Gandhi ’ s insight is being put to the test as never before .
the world is hitting global limits in its use of resources .
we are feeling the shocks each day in catastrophic floods , droughts , and storms – and in the resulting surge in prices in the marketplace .
our fate now depends on whether we cooperate or fall victim to self-defeating greed .
the limits to the global economy are new , resulting from the unprecedented size of the world ’ s population and the unprecedented spread of economic growth to nearly the entire world .
there are now seven billion people on the planet , compared to just three billion a half-century ago .
today , average per capita income is $ 10,000 , with the rich world averaging around $ 40,000 and the developing world around $ 4,000 .
that means that the world economy is now producing around $ 70 trillion in total annual output , compared to around $ 10 trillion in 1960 .
China ’ s economy is growing at around 10 % annually .
India ’ s is growing at nearly the same rate .
Africa , long the world ’ s slowest-growing region , is now averaging roughly 5 % annual GDP growth . overall , the developing countries are growing at around 7 % per year , and the developed economies at around 2 % , yielding a global average of around 4.5 % .
this is very good news in many ways .
rapid economic growth in developing countries is helping to alleviate poverty .
in China , for example , extreme poverty has been cut from well over half of the population 30 years ago to around 10 % or less today .
yet there is another side to the global growth story that we must understand clearly .
with the world economy growing at 4-5 % per year , it will be on a path to double in size in less than 20 years .
today ’ s $ 70 trillion world economy will be at $ 140 trillion before 2030 , and $ 280 trillion before 2050 if we extrapolate from today ’ s growth rate .
our planet will not physically support this exponential economic growth if we let greed take the upper hand .
even today , the weight of the world economy is already crushing nature , rapidly depleting the supplies of fossil-fuel energy resources that nature created over millions of years , while the resulting climate change has led to massive instabilities in terms of rainfall , temperature , and extreme storms .
we see these pressures every day in the marketplace .
oil prices have surged to more than $ 100 per barrel , as China , India , and other oil-importing countries join the United States in a massive scramble to buy up supplies , especially from the Middle East .
food prices , too , are at historical highs , contributing to poverty and political unrest .
on the one hand , there are more mouths to feed , and with greater purchasing power on average .
on the other hand , heat waves , droughts , floods , and other disasters induced by climate change are destroying crops and reducing the supplies of grains on world markets .
in recent months , massive droughts have struck the grain-producing regions of Russia and Ukraine , and enormous floods have hit Brazil and Australia ; now , another drought is menacing northern China ’ s grain belt .
there is something else hidden from view that is very dangerous .
in many populous parts of the world , including the grain-growing regions of northern India , northern China , and the American Midwest , farmers are tapping into groundwater to irrigate their crops .
the great aquifers that supply water for irrigation are being depleted .
in some places in India , the water table has been falling by several meters annually in recent years .
some deep wells are approaching the point of exhaustion , with salinity set to rise as ocean water infiltrates the aquifer .
a calamity is inevitable unless we change .
and here is where Gandhi comes in .
if our societies are run according to the greed principle , with the rich doing everything to get richer , the growing resource crisis will lead to a widening divide between the rich and the poor – and quite possibly to an increasingly violent struggle for survival .
the rich will try to use their power to commandeer more land , more water , and more energy for themselves , and many will support violent means to do so , if necessary .
the US has already followed a strategy of militarization in the Middle East in the naïve hope that such an approach can ensure secure energy supplies .
now competition for those supplies is intensifying , as China , India , and others bid for the same ( depleting ) resources .
an analogous power grab is being attempted in Africa .
the rise in food prices is leading to a land grab , as powerful politicians sell foreign investors massive tracts of farmland , brushing aside the traditional land rights of poor smallholders .
foreign investors hope to use large mechanized farms to produce output for export , leaving little or nothing for the local populations .
everywhere in the leading countries – the US , the United Kingdom , China , India , and elsewhere – the rich have enjoyed soaring incomes and growing political power .
the US economy has been taken over by billionaires , the oil industry , and other key sectors .
the same trends threaten the emerging economies , where wealth and corruption are on the rise .
if greed dominates , the engine of economic growth will deplete our resources , push the poor aside , and drive us into a deep social , political , and economic crisis .
the alternative is a path of political and social cooperation , both within countries and internationally .
there will be enough resources and prosperity to go around if we convert our economies to renewable energy sources , sustainable agricultural practices , and reasonable taxation of the rich .
this is the path to shared prosperity through improved technologies , political fairness , and ethical awareness .
new YORK – Baruch Spinoza , the seventeenth-century Dutch philosopher , Benjamin Disraeli , the nineteenth-century British prime minister , and Nicolas Sarkozy , the twenty-first century French president , have one thing in common : all were sons of immigrants .
people have migrated to other countries for thousands of years – to escape , prosper , be free , or just to start again .
not a few enriched their adopted homelands by achieving great things , or producing children who did .
new waves of immigrants are rarely , if ever , popular . but they are often needed .
many people have migrated to Western European countries from North Africa and Turkey during the last half-century , not because of Western generosity , but because they were required for jobs that natives no longer wanted .
they were treated as temporary workers , however , not as immigrants .
once the job was done , it was assumed that the migrants would go home .
when it became clear that most had elected to stay , and were joined by extended families , many were grudgingly allowed to become citizens of European states , without necessarily being treated as such .
xenophobes , as well as leftist multi-cultural ideologues , regarded these new Europeans as utterly different from the native born , albeit for different reasons .
multi-culturalists saw attempts to integrate non-Westerners into the Western mainstream as a form of neo-colonialist racism , while xenophobes just didn ’ t like anything that looked , talked , or smelled foreign .
we who live in rapidly aging societies , such as Western Europe or Japan , still need immigrants .
without them , necessary institutions , such as hospitals , would be unstaffed , and more and more elderly people would have to be supported by fewer and fewer young people .
and yet many politicians , especially in Europe , now treat immigration as a disaster .
new populist parties garner large numbers of votes simply by frightening people about the supposed horrors of Islam , or of clashing civilizations .
for the populists , however , the real enemies – perhaps even more nefarious than the immigrants themselves – are the “ cosmopolitan elites ” who tolerate and even encourage these horrors .
mainstream politicians are so afraid of this populist demagoguery that they often end up mimicking it .
the failure of integration of non-Western immigrants in such countries as France , Germany , or The Netherlands is often exaggerated by hysterical alarmists ; Europe , after all , is not about to be “ Islamized . ”
but the fact that some young people of African , South Asian , or Middle Eastern descent feel so alienated in the European countries of their birth that they are happy to murder their fellow citizens in the name of a revolutionary religious ideology , means that something is amiss .
children of immigrants in the past , however unwelcome they were made to feel , rarely wished to blow up the places to which their parents had chosen to move .
politics in many Muslim countries is partly to blame .
Islamist extremism is a handy revolutionary creed for vulnerable young people to latch onto , to gain a sense of power and belonging .
Hindus , Christians , or Buddhists lack such a cause , which is why political terrorism is largely confined to Muslims .
but , as the occasional riots in French immigrant areas show , violence is not confined to Muslims .
national policies have something to do with this , but so do the deeply flawed immigration policies in all European Union countries .
unlike in Canada or the United States , economic immigrants are not allowed to become citizens in exchange for their necessary labor .
but European welfare states are better equipped to deal with asylum-seekers and other newcomers as needy dependents than as people in need of a job .
when European politicians claim that France , Britain , or The Netherlands are not traditional “ immigrant countries ” like the US , they are right only up to a point , as the examples of Spinoza , Disraeli , and Sarkozy show .
what is true is that large numbers of de facto immigrants have accumulated in many countries in a very short time , in a haphazard way that makes it seem as though no government was ever in control .
children of guest workers feel unwanted .
refugees languish helplessly in welfare nets , or are suspected of being cheats .
and former colonial subjects , though in many cases remarkably well integrated , still bear the scars of troubled imperial histories .
Japan , and even the US , is not immune to these problems , either .
the Japanese government simply got rid of its Iranian guest workers when jobs dried up .
but it won ’ t be as easy to deal with the hundreds of thousands of Chinese who live in Japan without the rights of citizenship .
the same is true of Mexicans working in the US , often illegally .
millions of people around the world remain in limbo – often needed , or pitied , but nonetheless unwanted .
there is no quick or easy way out of this problem , especially in bad economic times .
but Europe – and Japan , for that matter – should start by making economic migration legitimate . this means working out what jobs need to be filled , and welcoming those who will fill them , not as guests , but as equal citizens .
it is a region composed of a common country that we share with the Palestinians .
it is a country that we call Israel and they call Palestine .
one and a half million people live in Gaza .
they are part of a people of whom another 1.3 million live in Israel , and another two million in the West Bank .
the men and women of Gaza are our neighbors and have lived back to back with us for a long time , even if we are separated from them by a border .
our homes and our cities are just a few kilometers from each other , our fields brush up against theirs .
the men of Gaza , the activists or policemen of Hamas whom we observe through our military binoculars , were in the past the activists and policemen of Fatah .
they were born in Gaza or pushed there as refugees during the war of 1948 , or in other wars . over the course of the years , they were the masons who built our homes , they washed dishes in the restaurants where we ate , they were the merchants from whom we used to buy goods , and workers in the greenhouses of the kibbutzim .
they are our neighbors , and they will be our neighbors in the future .
so , when we decide to fight a war against them , we have to consider very carefully the character of that war , its duration , and the effect of its violence .
we Israelis have no power to extirpate the Hamas government from Gaza , much as we did not have the power to eliminate the Palestine Liberation Organization ( PLO ) as the voice of the Palestinian people ’ s national aspirations , or Hezbollah from Lebanon in the war of 2006 .
Ariel Sharon and Menachem Begin went all the way to Beirut in the early 1980 ’ s , paying a terrible and bloody price , to try to eliminate the PLO – a result that could never be obtained .
and what happened ?
in the end , Sharon and then Binyamin Netanyahu both ended up sitting down at the negotiating table with Yassir Arafat and his representatives to try to reach an agreement .
now Arafat ’ s former deputy , Abu Mazen , is a frequent and welcome guest in our country .
we Israelis must begin to realize this simple fact : the Arabs are not metaphysical creatures , but human beings , and human beings have it within themselves to change .
after all , we Israelis change our positions , mitigate our opinions , and open ourselves up to new ideas .
so we would do well to get out of our heads as quickly as possible the illusion that we can somehow annihilate Hamas or eradicate them from the Gaza strip .
instead , we have to work , with caution and good sense , to reach a reasonable and detailed agreement for a lasting ceasefire that has within it the perspective that Hamas can change .
such a change is possible and can be acted upon .
such fundamental changes of heart and mind have happened many times in the course of history .
to be sure , even if , beginning today , we start working for such a lasting truce , there will inevitably be further days of war ahead . rockets will , no doubt , again be launched against us .
but at least we will know that we are not fighting for an impossible objective that can only result in blood and devastation – blood and devastation that will weigh on the collective memories of the sons and grandsons of our neighbors , who will remain our enemies , even if the spinning top continues to turn .
the West has dominated the world ever since the industrial revolution .
today that dominance seems threatened by the East Asian heirs to Confucianism , the ideology par excellence of state cohesion .
centuries of inculcation with Confucianism was as important to the rise of East Asia ’ s hyper-growth economies as the conjunction of Protestantism and the rise of capitalism was to the west .
Confucianism ’ s tenets still provide an inner compass to most East Asians in a post-Confucian age , just as Biblical admonitions remain standards for the West in a post-religious age .
the basic thrust of Confucianism has changed little since Confucius ’ s disciples recorded his aphorisms a generation before Socrates .
indeed , Confucianism became the official ideology of the Chinese state two centuries before the birth of Christ .
Confucianism was essentially a philosophical justification of government by benevolent bureaucracy under a virtuous ruler .
virtue ensured harmony between man and nature , as well as obedience within a stratified society .
as one Confucian classic put it : possessing virtue will give the ruler the people .
possessing the people will give him the territory .
possessing the territory will give him its wealth .
possessing the wealth , he will have resources for expenditure .
virtue is the root ; wealth is the result .
during the neo-Confucian renaissance of the eleventh and twelfth centuries , a metaphysical dimension was added to fill a gap exposed by Buddhism ’ s inroads into China .
thereafter , a good Confucian could , with untroubled conscience , scorn the Buddhist renunciation of the world .
this restatement of fundamental precepts restored Confucianism to a primacy in China and neighboring states that remained unchallenged for 700 years .
Neo-Confucianism provided the basic ideology for China ’ s admiring neighbors – Japan , Korea , and Vietnam – until the advent of the West .
its tenets were highly appropriate to the settled , sophisticated agrarian civilizations of pre-nineteenth-century East Asia , for they knitted together society and polity in a manner calculated to promote stability and harmony .
the ultimate guarantee of harmony was the ruler ’ s justness , which permitted him to enjoy the “ mandate of heaven ” ; the people had a right , indeed an obligation , to rebel against a tyrant .
but while the ethical basis of Neo-Confucianism was crucial , the Chinese also understood the need for a morally motivated bureaucracy , and thus perfected in the seventh century the world ’ s first examination system for selecting bureaucrats , with the Confucian canon as the syllabus .
of course , the Neo-Confucian system was not immune to mankind ’ s appetites .
many Confucian emperors were brutal .
yet stability was achieved .
there was only one change of dynasty in China between 1368 and the end of the imperial era in 1911 .
the Tokugawa Shoguns , who completed the reunification of Japan in 1600 , remained in power for more than two and a half centuries . in Korea , the Yi dynasty ruled from 1382 until the Japanese conquest of 1910 .
periodic civil strife and rebellion were not eliminated , but only in Vietnam was the longevity of a dynasty a cloak for inextinguishable internecine warfare .
like a happy and secure childhood , Confucian civilization bestowed upon its practitioners the self-confidence to meet the challenge of the West .
Confucian civic culture also provided the basis for a long history of successful self-government .
East Asians entered the modern world of nation states in self-consciously discrete secular units .
by contrast , the Indian subcontinent , with two major religions and a dozen major linguistic groups , was united in modern times only under British rule .
applied learning is the key to the post-Confucian states ’ success .
Confucian literati , shunning manual labor , grew their fingernails long , but they never displayed antipathy towards the world of affairs .
the Chinese myth of success was the bright peasant boy whose village clubbed together to educate him and whose subsequent success resulted in the elevation of all who had helped him on his way into the civil service .
ideally , state and family were mirror images .
the emperor was the supreme paterfamilias , his benevolent rule reciprocated by the obedience of his ministers and subjects , while family members were fixed in their appropriate hierarchical relationships .
families and nations that obeyed together stayed together .
Meiji Japan grasped the advantages of making the nation a macrocosm of the family .
an imperial order in 1890 outlined the objectives of education : the Confucian concepts of loyalty , obedience , and filial piety were to be transferred from the family to the nation .
at about the same time , the Chinese scholar Yen Fu – whose translations of Adam Smith , John Stuart Mill , Herbert Spencer , and Montesquieu were read even by the young Mao – also concluded that filial piety fostered habits of disciplined subordination to authority that could be applied to the factory and the polity .
during the past century , the post-Confucian states have accustomed themselves to a pluralistic world of theoretically equal nation states .
but it is difficult to know how deep that adjustment has gone .
if the West is perceived to be attempting to maintain the leadership it snatched 200 years ago by industrializing first , thereby denying the post-Confucians the fruits of their dynamism permanently , the Chinese , in particular , will conclude that pluralism is eyewash and that the West ’ s worldview in fact replicates their traditional one .
today ’ s trade and currency battles would then become a Kulturkampf .
in a few decades , when China ’ s economy equals America ’ s in size , the winner will be hard to pick .
better for the West to accept equality now – and struggle to maintain it .
in the 1990s Argentina implemented perhaps 80 % of the neoliberal economic policy agenda .
it opened up its economy to world trade and international capital ; it sought to guarantee low inflation and sound money .
it strove to improve its legal system so that decisions would accord with general rules and foster confidence that contracts would be enforced--whether or not a bribe had been paid .
it failed .
this is not to say that the 1990s , even with their aftermath leading into the terrible summer of 2002 , were catastrophic .
life was clearly worse during the Dirty War of the 1970s , when an army with no honor threw women out of helicopters into the South Atlantic , and urban guerrillas shot people because ... because ... well , just because !
the 1980s were hardly better .
starting with a full-fledged debt crisis triggered by a massive rise in both US interest rates and the value of the American dollar , the decade ended with domestically-generated hyperinflation , causing Argentina to fall a decade further behind the world &apos;s leading economies .
in the 1990s , by contrast , Argentina &apos;s GDP per capita grow by 25 % from trough to peak--only to lose this entire income gain over the past four years .
until late last winter , Argentina &apos;s problems seemed merely an unpleasant but temporary bump , in the same way that the 1994-1995 Mexican &quot; tequila &quot; crisis or the East Asian crises of 1997-1998 proved to be only temporary interruptions , not watersheds .
such optimism is impossible today , and there is little hope that the country &apos;s recent meltdown is only temporary .
the establishment view--say , in US Treasury Undersecretary John Taylor &apos;s office--is that Argentina &apos;s collapse is the fault of its politicians .
I half-agree with this view .
Argentine leaders were repeatedly warned that keeping the exchange rate constant and fixing the peso &apos;s value against the US dollar risked sending the economy into recession if the dollar gained value .
Argentine politicians were also warned that their peso policy could not be sustained unless the ratio of national debt to GDP was falling .
